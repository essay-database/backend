","As one of the few African American males enrolled in my high school, I feel a strong need to create a helpful and positive community for minority students that look like me. Through this need, I have taken on the position of Vice President with my school’s Black Student Union. As a third year officer of the Black Student Union, I have contributed to my club's efforts to provide a positive community and give back to others over a long period of time. Every year other BSU official and I are large parts of the program. I help put together everything that happen in the club. Recently, I was put in charge of officer polos. I did everything from collecting officer shirt sizes, designing the shirts, to ordering the shirts from the printing company. This year I was also put on the Club Day Team. I got to work with other members of the Black Student Union to put  together a table and an activities board, showing off our club to possible new members. I was allowed to design the board, decorate the table, and reach out to other minorities by passing out club flyers. During the holiday’s, the Black Student Union often puts on special holiday activities, my favorite of which is Thanksgiving baskets. Last Thanksgiving, me and one other member of the program were in charge of the junior class food item donation. I reached out to many of my fellow junior class mates at the time to ultimately win class to bring in the most items. But more importantly, the Black Student Union was able to supply nine families with thanksgiving dinners who may not have had one without such donations. Through the events and activities mentioned above, along with many more examples requiring dedication and commitment, I have  gained many valuable experiences helping me to see the effects of such commitment and to contribute to the Black Student Union for over three years.","What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?","My greatest talent is playing basketball. Growing up as an active child, I played multiple sports, but I always enjoyed basketball most of all. At first, I️ appreciated the social aspect of the sport. All I needed was a ball, a basket and a friend. Later, I grew to love the competition. Everyone wants to be the best player with the best team and the most wins. I love how if I am willing to put forward time and effort, I can become better than these opponents. As a child, my father told me to “stick to football” because I was no good at basketball, but this only encouraged me to become better at the sport that I loved. I play on an elite travel basketball team based out of Santa Ana, which is two and a half hours away from my hometown. In the last year, my team and I have traveled to places like Indianapolis and Las Vegas, and I️ have played against multiple top Division I recruits. I have come from being told to pick a new sport, to now having the opportunity to travel the nation based on my athletic abilities, but it took plenty of hard work and dedication to get to where I am today. I have sacrificed countless hours to a gym for practice, or just to get extra shots up. I have sacrificed friendships and other relationships due to lack of time or conflict in interest. I have sacrificed experiences, missing my school’s trip to France to play against one of the best travel teams in the world, Compton Magic. All of this sacrifice shows my dedication to developing my greatest talent. At the end of my junior year, my teammates selected me as the most valuable player of my varsity high school basketball team. Next year, I️ will continue to showcase my determination and will to improve by bringing the same characteristics I️ use in basketball to the college setting.","Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you.","In school, I find science to be the most enjoyable of all the subjects. I like science because it requires many different skills and it challenges me to understand the world around me. For example, last year I️ was enrolled in my favorite science class, Honors Physics, where my teacher not only taught me velocity equations, but challenged me further by requiring me to reading scientific plays and discussing science fiction topics. These activities, in their unorthodox approaches on science, furthered my passion for everything science stands for; like, understanding, answers, and problem solving. These are things that I wonder about on a daily basis. Unlike many other subjects, science usually works around real word problems. A science test question may ask how fire works or how gravity affects an object rather than how to solve an equation that can be calculated through a calculator. Science is not only my favorite subject, but it has affected how I go about my daily life. Science has influenced me to question the world around me like ancient scientists once did. To have new ideas that everyone may not accept. Question how something works, how it was made, what gives it its properties. Without questions there could not be answers. Science has taught me to reach toward understanding. I try to understand something and how it works rather than just memorize an equation or formula. This does not only pertain to school and learning, but to life. I try to understand a person before judging them, understand a situation before jumping to conclusions, even attempting to understand one's actions before committing to anger. So, as I️ continue on my journey through life and into college, I️ will take the lessons I️ learned from science into my everyday life, college field, and work place, by continuing to ask these question and continuing to reach for understanding. Science has not only been my favorite subject but it has influenced my life in many ways. This is why I love science.","What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?","This year I became a part of the 2017-2018 Ford Dream Builders. Ford Dream Builders is a very selective program, sponsored by the local Ford car dealership, geared toward building leadership skills and career readiness in high school students. We participate in multiple volunteering activities, along with being allowed to produce a large scale community service project by the end of my senior year. Of the many activities I have completed to better the community through Ford Dream Builders, I really enjoyed the “Spread the Love” event where I helped make over 500 peanut butter and jelly sack lunches for multiple local children’s organizations, including the Boys and Girls Club and the Police Activities League. For myself, I got to see, first hand, how people can come together to achieve a common goal. I found it very inspiring, when I took a step back, to see all of us working so hard to better our community and put a smile on children’s faces while we light-heartedly joked and laughed amongst each other. For myself and many others “Spread the Love” was fun and social, but at the same time I️ was helping to give meals to less fortunate children who may have gone without lunch if it weren’t for myself and others like me. I️ loved this feeling. With teamwork, communication, and a desire to help, I love how I can make a difference in my community or an individual's life and have an affect on something so much greater than myself. Through my sandwich making experience I️ plan to continue with this feeling. I️ will continue to help others, while aspiring to create a fun and positive atmosphere for others willing to help those in need. I️ also want to inspire not only my friends, but everyone to get out and feel the feeling I️ felt during “Spread the Love” by having a good time while bettering people's lives."]},{"id":"1-2GBEjONzYRaWB_P_rQ2Edfa7g3eUceIqypPUntHmQo","featured":true,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"","paragraphs":["Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time. ","My story not only list all the important aspects of my life; it explains how these events define me as a person.  I want to make those who supported throughout my journey proud, especially my parents. I feel I have to prove to them I can make it in life because of the mistakes my older siblings have made.  So I feel this is important to me because I do not want to disappoint them for all the time and money they invested in me.  In addition, I want to set an example for my older and younger siblings to show them anything is possible with hard work.  I am determined to accomplish this goal by taking every opportunity possible to fulfill my dream."," I am an African American male so I have a slight disadvantage toward among my students in my class.  I always get inferior looks when I am the only African American male in my advanced classes.  I am intimidated to ask questions because I feel other classmates would mock my intelligence.  This affected my grade and caused me to get my first C in math.  I was devastated and almost switched into a College Preparatory class, but I didn’t.  I thought to myself what kind of person I would be if I were to quit.  I stayed in the class and worked extra hard to prove I belong in the class.  I also took this as a learning experience; nothing is handed to you in life, you have to work for it.  "," ","This mentality applies in sports as well.  I have played soccer for about eleven years and I love the game, despite all the negative feedback I have encountered.  When I first signed up, my uncle criticized me because soccer was not a sport that not a lot of black people played.  This criticism fueled my drive to exceed in the sport and become a dynamic player.  I started to play organized club soccer, competition is intense.  I was the only African American on a predominantly hispanic team, and their skills were sharp.  I had to train everyday outside of practice to match the skills of my teammates.  This meant staying after practice to run extra sprints, training in unbearable weather and sacrificing my social life to pursue what I love.  ","                    ","Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.  ","I have been involved in leadership programs in school and sports.  Last year, my counselor recommended me for a Youth Leadership program to represent the school.  If selected, we would be able to tour around Bakersfield studying the different economic industries.  I never seen myself as a leader.  When I was younger I was not very social and kept my feelings and emotions to myself.  It was always my mother who made plans for me and spoke on my behalf.  It got so bad that I cannot even express myself to my own father, who always told me to be my own person and communication was key.  Eventually I had to break this bad habit when I wanted to switch high schools.  It was very stressful but we came to an agreement.  After that moment, I started to become more vocal in expressing myself to people and it had a profound impact on my social life.  I began to understand my father was right about communication and how it defines you as a person.  Even though my application was not accepted, I took this as a learning experience.  I wouldn't have been recommended for this if I did not show any leadership qualities so I feel I have the skills of being a responsible leader.","                      My leadership skills play a significant role in sports as well.  I wasn’t a vocal person so communicating to my teammates was difficult.  Since I was not able to communicate, it was difficult to manage the game.  As a result, it lead to a rough season of losses due.  It was tough seeing my teammates give up, so I decided next season was going to be different.  In one of our practices, I stepped out of my comfort zone and forced myself to communicate and it turned out very effective.  I began to incorporate this into our games and it resulted in our team winning league.  Even though I wasn’t an official captain, I was viewed as a resilient leader.","Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom. ","My favorite academic subject will always be math.  I love problem solving and being able to figure them out on my own.  I feel I acquired the love for math from my father because he loves figuring things out by himself and will never be satisfied until it is solved, no matter how long it takes.  Since math came natural to me, I was arrogant and did not need any help figuring out problems.  Also, I always got A’s and B’s in all of my math classes so I never needed help.  This mentality was pretty evident in my Precalculus class when I had got my first C.  So I came to the realization that asking for help doesn’t make me incompetent to solve problems.    ","I love math because it pertains to the potential career I want to pursue in.  My first career option is Mechanical Engineering.  I was intrigued by the hands-on part of the job, the problem-solving aspect and the numerous amount of mathematics involved.  In addition, the applications of this career varies so you are not limited to a specific job.  I was also fascinated by this career because I want to create something that is beneficial to my community.  I am not as involved in my community as I should be, but I do as much as I can to provide for it.  I volunteer through Frito-Lay and we donate to people less fortunate.  Every year, Frito-Lay does a backpack drive at a local Boys and Girls Club and we donate about 100 backpacks with various amount of school supplies to kids who cannot afford the simple essentials.  It makes me feel good to volunteer to help people in different communities.  I feel they look up to me for making an impact on their communities, no matter how big or small.  ","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.        ","My open-mindedness has helped me take advantage of various opportunities and resources presented to me.  I am always happy to broaden my scope with new options that are beneficial to my future.  It was not until my sophomore year that I started to express myself and become more vocal.  In turn, I became more involved in BSU and developed a close relationship with my advisor.  She then recommended me for the Experience Berkeley program.  She informed me that Berkeley was looking to raise its diversity rate by reaching out to minority group who meet the exceptional qualifications they were looking for.  So I filled out the application and I got accepted.  I did not have a clue about the admission process and how fast the deadline was approaching.  However, my mentor at Berkeley helped by simplifying everything to ensure that I understood everything.  I am glad I took this opportunity because I got a headstart on the admission process and information about college that I would have never figured out on my own.  In addition, I am grateful I was given this opportunity because raises my chances in getting into a college and making my parents proud."," I am the first to take initiative when it pertains to success in my future.  For instance, I love the game of soccer and want to pursue it after high school, so I do everything in my power to make sure I turn that dream in a reality. It was not until the beginning of junior year that I learned about how to get a soccer scholarship.  I had to email coaches of the colleges I was interested in and make online recruiting accounts.  I could not afford to go to many of the college camps I wanted to go to, so I was upset that I was missing an opportunity to meet with coaches face-to-face.  However, I got feedback from a lot of coaches I contacted and I was ecstatic because I am equipped to play at a college level and now my dreams are turning into a reality."]},{"id":"12dcOY8D091FuFmOcxRg8Q1rKxsfU0dkvx7MNAku_PJU","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"waitlisted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"","paragraphs":["Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time. ","Being a SOAR Ambassador has been one of the most satisfying high school activities for me thus far. Mentoring students empowers me to be an engaging leader; I have learned to blend their unfamiliarity with my experience. My desire to become a SOAR Ambassador is that no one in my home knew how to help me in school, and I want to provide my knowledge to the kids who are like me and need guidance and help. I was entrusted with six students, three each year; each attempting to find themselves, in this dual-enrollment high school and college setting. I am a leader to these girls, and I love it because I'm influencing them to be smarter, stronger, and better altogether. At the request of one mentee, I helped her plan her next four years of high school and guide her on how to get an AA degree. That plan I made for her turned into a form, that I created for the entire school to use, to plan out how to get an AA if desired. On another occasion, I helped tutor my mentees in math and their skills and scores improved. In a survey assessing mentors, my mentees reported that I was doing exceptionally well as their mentor, and along with other successful mentors, we were rewarded with tickets to a UCLA Bruins basketball game. The skills that generated the positive feedback on the survey were my planning, communication, and caring, which I express amongst my mentees. I expressed these skills by tutoring them, helping their time-management by planning, and listening to them. My mentees are now better prepared for the rest of high school and I continue to do this even today. My traits as an overachieving student are blending into these kids, and I can see how I'm affecting my school community positively by contributing to the success of the kids who want to achieve things in life. This experience is teaching me what it means to be a leader and gives me purpose to engage in programs where I can give back to my community.","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.","Applying and being accepted into SOAR High School, an early college high school, located on the Antelope Valley Community College campus, has been the biggest educational advantage I've taken. In this program students are concurrently enrolled in high school and college for all four years. It allows kids an opportunity to achieve an AA degree or complete IGETC transfer requirements. By the time I graduate I will have 60 units in college, two associate degrees, and completion of the honors program at AVC. The college courses and textbooks are paid for through an agreement between SOAR High School and AVC, and it is an amazing opportunity to take college classes while in high school. Joining this high school program was a great significant educational opportunity because I am making a contribution to my education and my future, along with my participation in clubs and community service. Making this decision was huge because I sacrificed a regular comprehensive high school experience; we are a small school community, with about 400 students, no sports and few clubs. I had to be mature enough to handle the dual enrollment. I was ready to take on this program because I knew this program would be an amazing educational opportunity. From the experience I learned to be more mature and it has prepared me for a University.","On top of SOAR itself, joining the honors program at AVC is another significant educational opportunity in addition to my original goal of graduating from AVC and SOAR. It is a challenge for me because it is extra coursework on top of the regular college course requirements. My honors classes consist of many intriguing class discussions, research papers, and heavy communication with professors. With this honors program, six of my 60 college course units will receive honors college credit, making me an honor certified student. Doing the honors program at AVC has shaped me with integrity, maturity, and ambition. ","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?","Beginning in the 5th grade, I started having migraines, and they came twice a week with throw up. I had problems concentrating and getting work done because my head would be thumping with massive pain, and it created a massive amount of stress, as it challenged my perseverance. I began seeing a neurologist, taking on-set medication, all while dealing with tests, quizzes, and lectures on top of the pain. Starting freshman year of high school, I had migraines every day lasting throughout the day. Six month visits with my neurologist and prescribed daily medication became a way of life for me, until the migraines returned. The next treatment was an intravenous therapy session, which failed, and then another daily medication that gave me ALL the listed reactions and caused me to be bedridden. Following the sickness I began having massages from the waist up for the pain and fortunately my migraines were completely eliminated. ","During this entire time I've dealt with migraines, it's been hard to stay at school and focus with such pain, but I do, because I feel school is very important and as long as the pain is tolerable to an extent, I manage. The times I've happened to miss school, I never allowed myself to fall behind, regardless of my pain; I would get my work done. It really challenged me to be 100% when my body only felt 50%, but I managed because my dedication is to my education. I got through by getting healthy with good eating habits, a good sleep routine, and learning to manage my stress. I had to ensure my eating habits included three meals a day, always breakfast, snacks, and plenty of water. The other adjustment was in my sleep patterns to determine the amount of hours of sleep necessary to feel at my best. It taught me how to manage my pain and stress by putting forth a mindset to cover for the temporal lack of physical strength within me. In overcoming this challenge, I learned that I can conquer anything impeding my academic achievement. ","Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?","As a driven and intelligent Latina, I've proven to myself and others that I will not accept the same environment I was raised in and simply accept it, but instead I'm fighting to live and become better than the circumstances I was brought up in. I've grown up with a binge drinker dad and a mother who loves to gamble at casinos. When my dad binge drinks, for weeks at a time, my mom will go to the casino and leave me with whoever will watch me till she gets back. My parents provide and care for me, but during these times, I feel invisible, and it hurts my mental state and affects my ability to focus on my education. During the times when I couldn't go home I learned to arrange my life so that my home situation didn't interfere with school. I had to keep track of what needed to be in my backpack to make sure I'd be able to do my schoolwork while my parents decided to not act as parents. I had to grow up quickly to be able to take care of myself as best as I could with my living circumstances. Despite having no parents to care for me in those bad moments, I took this time to make a life of my own and create a resilient personality in myself. I've managed to maintain great grades in a challenging school, care for myself, be involved in my community, and next May, I will graduate from high school with my diploma and a week later, I'll graduate from community college with two AA degrees. I didn't let anything or anyone stop me since childhood, although I lived this lifestyle I promised myself I wouldn't let this be my future. I believe my experience sets me apart because few students are able to change the trajectory of their life at such a young age. What I learned is that I control my education, which determines my future."]},{"id":"1CXUaseHkTqpWnDzRafrUS8GjCGSMu5zGfpsrzXl5mQ8","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"rejected","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"","paragraphs":["Think about an academic subject that inspires you.

I was taught math from a very young age which was when my love for math first began. I fell in love with math because it was vast and new. I knew math would be one the hardest to comprehend and I enjoyed the challenge of learning new things. Almost everything in life can be set up and solved in the same formula as a math problem.  Due to math I  built up tolerance and perseverance due to the repetition of solving similar math problems over and over again which helps me stay cool headed in annoying or challenging situations. No matter how simple a problem may seem math has taught me to not take shortcuts because you might move too fast and skip over a step and make a mistake. Math has also taught me how to check over myself in order to avoid mistakes, which ensures me to be as accurate and efficient as possible. I learned how to organize my time in the most efficient way from math. I can figure out how much time a task should take me to complete and which allows me to create and follow a schedule that employs the best use of my time. Math is used everyday in life such as counting money, reading the time, and even checking your phone's battery percentage. Math is more than just adding and subtracting numbers, it is one of the most important tools that I use to tackle some of the hardest problems and situations such as budgeting my money. I view math as a lifestyle especially because there are many types of maths that cover subjects such as statistics which studies chance, means and averages, all of which are important to real everyday life. This lifestyle has taught me how to be critical, hard-working, and tolerant and I would not be anywhere near as successful without math.","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.","I have involved myself with many different educational opportunities in order to prepare myself for college. The first step I took was joining AVID, a program recognized for preparing students for college. I joined AVID in the 7th grade. When I first joined AVID I hated AVID and thought that it was useless and pointless so I quit AVID in the 8th grade. I did so because I did not realize that while AVID felt as if it was not helpful, the work that was given and taught prepared you on how to be a successful College Student. I joined AVID again in the 9th grade because I decided to give it a second chance. In the 9th and 10th grades I still carried the same hateful attitude towards AVID, however, I stuck with AVID. In the 11th grade my attitude towards AVID  started to shift. And now Since being in AVID I have become more organized which was one of my major weaknesses before AVID. Besides being more organized, AVID has also helped guide me on the process of College applications and the FAFSA. Being in an AVID class with other AVID students have connected me with like minded students that push me harder and harder in order to be competitive with those students. My AVID class has bonded and grew closer and now we are a big family where everyone is accepted. Another opportunity to prepare myself for college was The PSAT. I took the PSAT starting my 8th grade year. The PSAT prepared me for the SAT by introducing me to SAT style questions and pointing out my strengths and weaknesses which told me what I needed to study. During my high school career, I have taken multiple Honors and AP classes which challenged and opened my way of thinking critically. Honors and AP classes are more rigorous which adds stress and  are more time consuming. These opportunities, as well as others, have put me on a path which has prepared me for college.","What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?  ","In my community I have made a difference in many ways that have created  positive impacts. At first  In my community, I was a boy scout. I was a member of Troop 118 and we underwent many programs to help the community. Being in Boy Scouts teaches morals and ethics to younger and older boys. One specific example of leadership I undertook was at a camp for the younger boy scouts. I volunteered as one of the older boy scouts which help the Scoutmaster watch the kids and make sure they are safe and protected. At school, I joined this program called MESA in which we tutor kids after school. This program helps those who are struggling in the area of math.  I volunteer at the library. Often times I am asked to teach the newer volunteers. In my home, I often run errands for my grandparents because they often don't have the energy to go shopping or to get food. Every Sunday I drive my grandma to church and back home. My grandma is involved with many programs in our church that involve youth and teens so without me driving her she would not be able to perform these actions. When we go grocery shopping, my grandma gives me the list and I go and grab the items off the list in the store. At church every Saturday I volunteer to clean up the church at 8 am. I am also apart of the Junior Usher Board for my church. Every 2nd and 5th Sunday we guide people to their seats and bring fans, programs, and envelopes. When I usher, I help preserve the order of the church and quickly get people into their seats so as to not cause a distraction. When I am not ushering, I help out in Children's Church and teach lessons to those in Children’s Church. These are some of the leadership roles I have had in my house, community, and school.","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge.

As an African American male, society typically places us at the bottom of the list. When I was young I witnessed my family act ghetto which led me to believe as a black male that how I was supposed to behave. Thus in elementary school I fell behind academically because I felt that since I was a black male I wasn’t supposed to care about school. As my grades started to fall my 3rd-grade teacher told me that I wasn’t going to succeed in math and I almost believed her because I believed black men couldn’t succeed in school. In middle school, I started off terribly. I tried to fit in however in return my grades fell as I was barely getting C’s. I fell asleep in classes and I often got sent out of class. Also, I didn’t have a relationship with my teachers and constantly argued with them during class. In 9th grade, things changed because I realized that if I continued down this path that it was leading nowhere. I pushed myself towards success by spending more time on homework and studying. Instead of  C’s I was getting  A’s and a few B’s. This success was addictive and encouraged me to pursue it more. My sophomore year I decided to take advanced classes. I realized the advanced pace was better for me because the other students who weren't serious about school weren’t in my classes and didn’t distract me. I grew connections with my teachers and gained a good reputation amongst teachers. At the end I came to the realization that although I was black male I still could succeed just like anyone else."]},{"id":"1EyxPsZyaa4OlvmATPKcYooFNZXGFME5l0cRWsfUtHs0","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"rejected","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"","paragraphs":["<prompt>Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time. </prompt>","Throughout my years in both middle school and high school, I have taken up many leadership positions.

Not only do I play a key role in keeping the program updated about the happenings around the college I also serve a key role in planning for the whole program. It is one of my jobs to help build a schedule for the programs 200+ students.

Since I took the class as a night school option it was not just students taking Spanish 1 it was for Spanish 1, 2, and 3; this lead to me having a hard time keeping up and leaving me ultimately confused. However, regardless of the reason I do not deal with failure very nicely and this grade stressed me out to the max. I quickly had to rearrange my previous educational plans in order to make up for this terrible grade. I had decided to take both semesters of Spanish for summer school in order to take Spanish 2 when I started my junior year. This changed however when I was accepted into my district’s Middle College program at Moreno Valley Community College. I was not able to make it up over that summer but I did take it in that fall semester. Even though it was a college class it was easy to follow and allowed me to actually learn about the language itself. Continuing with the fact that it was a college class, in order to make up for the fact that is was still in high school I worked even harder than usual. Constantly studied both the upcoming material and what we were learning at that time. I also made it my habit to listen to Spanish music while working so that I was surrounded by the language.

Growing up I would always hear how naturally smart they were when it came to things like GATE (Gifted and Talented Education) testing and grades. I, being the only one who did not test into GATE, felt that I was not as good as them when it came to school. However, since I did not like this way of thought I worked for admittance into the program and was allowed to join the GATE program as long as I kept my grades up. So growing up I would work twice as much as they would so that I would never be seen as below them. This included making sure I would get the same teachers that my older brother had so that I knew I would have the same amount of coursework. By doing this I created opportunities to excel myself and not allow for slacking off. This moved me from just barely being allowed into GATE to a hard worker who deserved to be there. I now aim for the best for everything I do in school. This includes sports, grades, clubs, leadership positions, and many more. If I believe it will be good for my future I want to take part in. Now this has helped me out, but there were some downsides to this way of thinking. I did not like my younger sister very much growing up because I would always feel that she was better than me because of her natural born advantage, being that she was considered smarter than me. So in order to become a better person for both of our sakes I switched up my way of thinking and worked hard on becoming a better person altogether. Thus, overcoming this complex of mine has reduced my worry of what would become of my relationship with my siblings. ","<prompt>Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom. </prompt>","When it comes to my favorite subject in school I find it hard to settle on just one. I absolutely love anything and everything that has to do with the science. Chemistry, biology, psychology, earth science, etc. all of it is connected and opens a door to something new. Every time I learn something new from one subject I quickly try to see how it relates to another. However, if I had to choose one it would be chemistry. Which relates to my intended field of study of chemical engineering. Because I loved learning so much concerning science I knew I wanted to do something that kept me close to it. I finally decided I wanted to study chemical engineering during my sophomore year when I took chemistry for the first time. Day after day it continued to call on my attention and I explored further into the world of chemistry. As I did learn more I realized how much I loved it and wanted to continue to surround myself with it. Therefore, I made the decision to dedicate my major to chemistry. However, I was not sure what field of chemistry at first it took me some time to decide. I finally did decide when I realized that I would be able to mix together chemistry and one of my most outstanding qualities: improving things that already exist. That being said the impact chemistry has had on me and will continue to have on me will be one that will last a lifetime."]},{"id":"1IG_qUObjTcTt2j2thM0X6wmIwDyG6K5pt3_2gW-rrd4","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"","paragraphs":["What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? ","Captivating an audience has always been my strong suit,  I definitely am able to herd in people’s attention and also provide them the ears needed to later broadcast their words. Public speaking is something I’ve been comfortable with since I was twelve, I'm confident but not so brazen that I'm unapproachable. It’s a strong factor for me as a leader because I feel like it's my best connection to my peers; it establishes a mutual respect. Public speaking has been a skill I've exercised in many situations, from being elected for secretary of Spanish Honor Society to speaking in familiar circles such as my youth group. I’ve held positions as simple as a representative and as difficult as president, but no matter the title I find that eloquence comes in use each time."," This year I studied rhetoric in AP English Language. The class has significantly helped me with making sure that whenever I speak, I do so collectively and firmly. Strengthening my voice has tremendously enhanced my leadership skills, so much that I've felt confident enough to take the challenge of restarting a dying club. Speaking out makes me feel empowered and helps me to realize how significant I can be to the world. I know there is power in words and not just my own. That's why I am prepared to revive the Black Student Union on my campus this coming year; it is a club that I owe much to. It was a place of opportunity and nurturing for me and my desire is to give back ensure it lives for the students to come. I want to leave something behind for the future that expands students’ capacity. As a senior I'm going to foster a place where others can come to learn, speak, and spread the same empowerment I feel, because looking back on my high school career, public speaking was the forte that solidified the leader I am today. "," Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.","An educational barrier I have faced is financial restriction. I come from a family of seven children, a dollar holds heavy value in my home. Both my father and mother lack the sufficient resources needed to support many activities. During high school all the pamphlets and college plans encouraged students to visit and experience the campuses they were considering.  All of the Californian universities I had interest in were at least two hours away; it wasn’t really in my parents’ capabilities to simply pick up and take me to visit them. But despite this, I wouldn't let myself be hindered. I sought out an alternative, any way for me to get what I needed.","    I soon learned about Project BEST (Black Excellence in Scholarship and Teaching) in my school and joined. I later came to know that the group focused on touring California’s campuses and exposing student to the many options for college. My freshman and sophomore year I devoted myself and visited five universities, Stanford and four UC campuses included. Being in that environment was a splash of cold water in my face. I was shaken — and even more — awoken. These were some of the best some schools, harboring some of the very best minds, and they were within my reach. I realized It wasn't impossible. I'd found a way to get myself this far. I told myself if I really wanted it, money wasn't going to stop me; I'd get myself farther. ","   It was an amazing opportunity that I didn’t hesitate to take advantage of, and that exposure has made me aware of my options and what universities are best for me and my goals. Participating in the Experience Berkeley itself this summer was a incomparable privilege that I was able to use and I am completely grateful for the help it has given me. College is the next milestone of my life! I have been and will continue doing all I can to ensure that I give myself the best chance possible to pursue my passions.","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?","In my seventeen years the greatest challenge I have ever faced was adjusting to the drastic changes that struck my life when I was twelve. My entire life up to that year I hadn’t known there was much of a world past my small town because I became so accustomed to my surroundings. It was predominantly Mexican-immigrant and predominantly low income. That summer of 2010 my parents had divorced; their marriage had been under financial stress among other things. I had expected my life to change as far as my parents separating, but I hadn't expected to find myself in Bakersfield at a whole new school and experiencing my first case of culture shock. It seemed as though my whole life had been uprooted and I was forced to adjust to it. I loved my school and life in Wasco, but coming to Bakersfield threw me from a pond to a lake, and I wasn't the big fish anymore. For the first time in my life I wasn't able to give basic effort, I didn't have the reassurance that I’d still be number one. If I wanted to be distinguished here, I'd have to really work. It was this moment I learned that if you don't hustle and commit to do something, someone else will sweep past and do it for you. ","The academics were better here and the people another economic class. I realized that I wanted to succeed farther than my parents and I wanted to be just as smart and driven as the kids at my school. Being shown a grander life encouraged me to stay motivated, to stay progressing. That year I received national honor and recognition for my academic success in the United States Achievement Academy. I had thought to myself, “these kids are going to take off into the big world and I can't let them leave me behind.” ","The challenge of change affected my life from that day on. I am still driving forward with the same competitiveness, the same determination to set my goals and reach them because I promised to be just as much a part of the world as anyone.","Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?","I have a burning desire to change the condition of the world around me and I believe it's what sets me apart from any other person. I am passionate about increasing my knowledge of cultures and the developments of peoples and countries. Transitioning to my college I know now I'd like to use the UCs' courses to expand my knowledge as a global citizen and grant me the skills I need to make an active difference. It is ultimately my goal to be a woman who aids poverty-stricken countries through medicine. The passion I feel for this has given me a drive like no other. I've seen poverty and I know I want to make a difference.","My spring break of sophomore year I had the opportunity to visit my grandfather for the first time since he had been deported a year prior. I lived for a week in poor Mexico and I was astounded. Parents worked all day and children cared for their siblings; all they were doing was surviving day by day. In America kids have iPads, in Mexico they have worn shoes and their imaginations. I played outside, I remembered what it was to be left to my own devices — to be unprivileged. I purchased candy for less than a dollar, so much less that I was able to buy for all of the children who had been playing “en la calle”. The people are poor and growing poorer; I came to find my own grandfather couldn’t afford proper surgery. It was staggering to realize conditions in other countries were far worse than this. The people here at least had drinkable water, but there are countries lacking even that. ","Being Afro-Latina, I have and will face adversity, but nothing will stand in the way of my passion. I've been so blessed it's time I do unto others. I need to be the change and I know with the University of California I will garner the knowledge, experience, and confidence to do so. I cannot change the world on my own, but I am determined to be a step in that direction. I'm going to be the change — that's what sets me apart."]},{"id":"1NsGqSoIZ8ukZvRytJB7PBFf3HHx09cnNDiuPvlkVL0U","featured":true,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"","paragraphs":["Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.  ","I applied to be captain of my colorguard team my junior year. I was awarded the position, and with that, the responsibility of running an entire class period by myself. Coaches weren’t present during the school day, which left me to find a way to tame a rambunctious group of fourteen year olds. In my first attempts of running the class, my team members began to resent me. Too much of our time was wasted by talking and refusing to dress out in a timely manner. The team members that were dedicated were thrown off by this group of freshmen who were loud and disrespectful. I was open to constructive criticism, but when I asked them how they felt I was failing as a captain, no one had an answer for me. Complaining to my coach that the team was disrespectful only prompted her response that I will not get respect if I do not demand it. ","Well that’s what I had to do. I told the more mature team members that I was depending on them to be role models and not encourage disruptive behavior. I had to take phones away and move talkative members, but I also made time to talk to everyone and create moments for the team to bond. At the end of every major season I hosted a party at my house for the team in which we livestreamed finals and enjoyed each other's company. By combining a sense of communication along with being more assertive, I was able to construct a productive class period. They dressed out, I led stretches and exercises, and cleaned parts of our show until the period was over. Most importantly, I emphasized working alongside them. I took every repetition they did, and I opened myself to the same criticism I subjected them to. Our coaches noticed the improvement and even other team members thanked me for pushing them to be better. Today, we are a world class team. I am proud to say that I have helped build us up and left a legacy for years to come. ","Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.  ","My greatest passion in life is dancing. I began dancing when I was four years old, but I did not truly love it until I entered high school. My school was a lonely place freshman year, and along with many other fourteen year olds, I struggled to define myself. Even as I began to practice with my color guard team, I felt the pressure of needing to be a better dancer. Then I had my first performance. Words cannot describe the freedom and certainty I felt as I danced and spun my flag across the football field. Nothing mattered to me but the moves I made in that moment. ","Through my high school career I have been asked to create rifle choreography for our first JV Color Guard team, a visual for the Bulldog Brigade’s showing of Cirque Du Soleil, and be an assistant choreographer to the Bulldog Theater Company’s production of The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee. The school musical was the longest and most daunting task, because I was responsible for dance work that would soon be performed for a paying audience. In the beginning I found myself constantly looking to the head choreographer to validate my work. However, as I began to understand the show and the characters, I saw how movement would bring each piece of music to life. A week before opening night, the ballet number of the show had been untouched by the head choreographer, so I choreographed it myself. I taught  turns, jumps, and a lift to the two actors in the number. They rehearsed with me for hours to polish every move. I watched them take my work and embed it into a story, and it was awe inspiring to see my passion on stage. Most rewardingly, the audience reacted with the laughs and sighs of adoration I had hoped to provoke from them. Then I understood that dance is not only where I gained the confidence to express my ideas. It’s a form of communication that requires empathy, a skill I can use in every aspect of life and profession. ","What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? ","My forearms were black and blue, my entire body was sore, and I had never been more determined in my life. My sophomore year, I was finally given the chance to be on my color guard saber line. This was my first time spinning a weapon, and I felt that I had to prove my right to have this spot on the team. During my first week on this new piece of equipment, I was told I had to toss a five. Every practice I would work on tossing. I’d watch the saber spin one, two, three, four, five times in the air for it to only come back down to strike my wrist. I’d try again, tossing the saber up, watching it spin with my hands stretched out to hopefully catch it. It loudly crashed on the gym floor. I felt embarrassed. I wanted so badly to not disappoint my coaches. The point of me auditioning was to improve, to show that I can move up in this sport. Fortunately, there was one senior on my team that wanted me to succeed almost as much as I did. She tossed with me, critiqued me, and always gave me words of encouragement. I tried again to fulfill this one request from my coach. The saber spun in the air one, two, three, four, five times, and it landed perfectly in my hopeful, outstretched hands. From then on, I only improved. Once I understood how to manipulate the equipment in the most basic ways, I was able to be taught any choreography that included this piece of equipment. My arms returned to a healthy color and I showed my coaches what I was capable of. I performed basic tosses, tosses I turned under, and even just danced with my saber. I say spinning saber is my greatest skill not only because I can now do it almost flawlessly, but because I gained this skill through determination and dedication. It reminds me that I’ve improved from the person I was just months before picking up a saber for the first time. "," Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.","I will never dread going to the dentist again. However, dread was exactly what I felt the last time I had an eight am dentist appointment. The last thing I expected was for my check up to result in an educational opportunity. My mother had been bragging about my inclination towards medicine to my dentist, and as I blushed and went to excuse my mother from the doctor, he asked if I would like to shadow him. He had a crown placement coming up, and thought I could benefit from seeing how dentistry worked. I thanked him repeatedly in my flustered excitement, and then thanked my mother for speaking so fondly of me.","My first day in the cold dentist office was a four hour shift with Dr.Ismailyan. I had hope that by shadowing him I would further understand the true life and responsibility of a doctor. During my time there, I  was taught the difference between porcelain and silver fillings, saw how a crown was made and placed, and was introduced to the journey that is creating a well adjusted pair of dentures. I saw that no moment was wasted. If a patient wasn’t being seen, we were prepping for the next or writing reports on the last. I especially enjoyed meeting the other doctors in the office and discussing their different educational routes.","When seeing patients, Dr. Ismailyan would quiz me with questions about the tools he used. I was able to tell him that the gel he was using would prevent bleeding, or the blue paper he asked patients to grind between their teeth would prove a successful filling was done. Standing over his shoulder, taking notes as he consulted with and operated on patients led me to deciding two things. First, My future will be dedicated to helping others. Second, I want to study medicine, because under all the excitement, there was a sense of belonging."]},{"id":"1V12Bk-3-jHFLMLy2rTkM71UwQfGu8yM2Y911lK1dBH4","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"waitlisted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"","paragraphs":["Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.  ","I’ve utilized my creative and artistic individuality to impact my community and worldwide. Firstly, I created an online blog Blogging Everything Beautiful. I promote reading and literature and its significance to all age groups. For two years now, my blog has become a platform to express two of my passions, reading and art. On my website I graphically designed images. This expanded my knowledge when it came to working with design technology that I had little experience with. As someone who has enthusiasm for reading, I enjoy expressing my thoughts when it comes to reviewing and analyzing different works to a wider audience. Consequently, I’m able to gain different perspectives. ","Being able to create an important art piece out of nothing really allows me to draw inspiration and past experiences from myself. This action enables me to self-reflect and realize how creating makes me feel internally -- happy, calm, and free. I’ve recently started to invest into the diverse community and advocate for authors of color and representation of cultures. This has given me exposure to what I’m passionate about, equality, and how I can involve my talent to advocate. Painting and blogging has become a hobby that I plan to make use of in the future to help balance leisure and work time. I’m definitely eager to progress over time as I believe that I have the ability to develop my creativity.","In addition to my blog, I’m also an online marketplace seller on Etsy. I showcase my artistic abilities by offering my paintings and works up for sale. I’ve been trying different mediums over the course of years, however I’m most comfortable with acrylic paint because of its ability to create such opaque images.  As I’ve experimented with new techniques, I’ve come to love self-expressive art movements such as Post Impressionism and Abstract Expressionism. I utilized my creative side in order to put myself on the marketplace, but to also structure my self confidence. To be creative in multiple ways is a fortunate aspect that I take advantage of, especially artistically and using innovative thinking to solve personal problems.","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced. ","One opportunity that I have taken advantage of is the Education Talent Search Program powered by UC Davis. ETSP is a free program targeted towards students in need of guidance and support throughout their education. This support can range from providing a FAFSA mentor to students, from receiving workshops for the UC Application process.  During my sophomore year, I was invited to the program by my high school’s ETS adviser. I felt that I could utilize extra information to ensure a stable education and maintain an enthusiastic attitude throughout high school. I’ve been encouraged to focus on career paths and financial aid opportunities, such as EOP in college. For example, I’ve taken advantage of being informed about SAT and ACT deadlines, as well as scholarship information and guidance for the Cal State Apply.  I knew that I wanted to be aware of educational options that I could use to be prosperous for my future. With that being said,  I attended the meetings and kept in touch with my ETS adviser every month. I took advantage of being able to receive SAT and ACT waivers, attending Senior Day at a UC Campus, and to a Preview Day for incoming college freshmen. These exposures were valuable as this was an educational opportunity for me to ready myself. I’ve been able to visit several University campuses within California, speak to students that attend UCs and CSUs, and get connected with further resources that have expanded my range of possibilities. By investing myself into ETS, I’ve been able to recognize just how much there is to know about my future. This program has become important in supporting and guiding my academic work. Therefore, I took a significant advantage into my own hands and used resources available that will benefit me in the future. Overall it has become a major commitment worth my attention.","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement? ","The most significant challenge that I have faced is when I realized that I may be clinically depressed. This was a constant challenge that affected my educational performance, communication skills, and comfortability within my household and community. At the time, I frequently dismissed this mentality as I needed to focus on my schoolwork. However, my academic execution was negatively impacted as I was inattentive in class and neglected to sleep or eat. Throughout the past years I’ve still been overcoming this challenge, but it has become less difficult. I decided to use my resources and reach out to media sources, such as the Buddy Project, and my closest friends. The Buddy Project allows people to communicate with individuals who may have similar experiences to you. In the past, I was hesitant when it came to asking for help because I was content with being independent. I knew that I needed to take the situation into my own hands because it was ultimately affecting my academic achievements. I resorted to the first step of revitalization which is self-reflection. I focused on what wasn’t enjoyable about my unsettled development and I brainstormed ideas to dismiss these aspects from my life. This was the most difficult part of overcoming this challenge and I still haven’t entirely completed this step. However I found what I love and used that as a goal or reassurance that I can progress. I discovered that I’m more than this obstacle and now I can apply this experience to become a better me. I’ve acknowledged the negative environment that I was creating and realized that I didn’t want to be filled with sorrow and misplacement anymore. So I found myself a home. This sense of place was within my blog, my education, and literature. Often I was doubting my abilities because of my depression, but to overcome this I continued to understand my successes academically or personally. In fact, I’ve used this challenge to spark interest in future fields of study, such as psychology and sociology. I hope to apply this knowledge to a career as well.","What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?  ","At school I am currently the Vice President of Around the World club. Our main objective is to influence the school to acknowledge the world around us and how we can make a difference. We’ve organized an annual Breast Cancer Awareness Fundraiser and also collaborated with local companies to raise money for those affected by the Napa Valley Atlas Fires. In the past, we have visited local community centers to read to the youth and educate them. As a whole, we’ve become advocates of spreading awareness of the conditions of our community. This advocacy could range from environmental issues to social standards.  In order to get these events running within the club, I have taken the initiative of emailing companies professionally and handling paperwork throughout each meeting. Skills that I use within this club include using an authoritative voice when needed and applying my creative perspective towards producing effective fundraisers for my community.","Another form of community service that I have committed to is within the North Bay Mustangs Youth Sports Organization. Again, this is a community-based organization that has a main objective of keeping children away from bad influences, such as drugs, in order to keep them active and healthy. Using my morals and expressing good habits has become a vital part in making my community a better place, and it has been a privilege to be able to have a leadership role within it. I had the opportunity to involve myself with the youth and keep them active. This is done by attending their practices and games and being a figure of eagerness for the children. I also enthusiastically socialize and work with the team and family members in order to make their experience as worthwhile as mine. These opportunities and engagements have allowed me to become extroverted and to really apply my adventurous attitude in order to share my passions and create a better community  for future generations. I am now able to manage my life and other aspects adequately and prepare myself for other impactful developments."]},{"id":"1jsgjNd20q1FLd0Ek8_mqCjEXzu8W051rflMx7puyIF0","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"waitlisted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"","paragraphs":["Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.  ","During junior year I was part of both Link Crew and Track. I joined Link Crew because my freshman year wasn’t fun, I had no Link Leader to turn to, and was left alone to figure out my way, so I wanted to make sure other freshmen didn’t have to go through what I went through. Being a Link Crew Leader, the freshmen who did Track found it easier to talk and hang out with me more than the other upperclassmen because I had met them before during Freshman orientation and Link Crew classroom visits. During one of our conversations Devyn, One of these freshman, told me that he believed that track was taking time away from him working on his football skills. He expressed to me that all of the other freshmen on the team were becoming better football players than he was and that they were passing him up. When he told me about this, I had an idea how to help him out using my knowledge that I gained from being both an athlete and in Link Crew, and I was able to give him some key advice. I let him know that Track was teaching him proper running form, increasing his speed, and improving his stamina; however, if he was not working on his football skills outside of Track also, the other freshmen would pass him up (regardless of his speed gains). He says the talk I gave him really helped him and I'm happy to say that he decided to stay in Track going on to compete on our JV 4x1 team. He also made Varsity football during the tryouts over summer. In a way, my experience with Devyn taught me a lot. It’s easy to assume leaders are born and not created, however what I have learned is that true leaders are often a product of circumstance. I was put in the right “circumstance” (being in Track as well as a Link Crew Leader) in order to affect another. I believe leadership is the ability to “step up” when you are needed. In this situation I was needed and because of my choice, I was able to positively influence someone and guide them on their most ideal path.

Describe how you express your creative side.  ","I started dancing when I was seven in a Hip Hop crew, however around the time I was nine one of my teachers who we called “Junior” was arrested and the other being his wife (Chantelle) was unable to continue. Jr really was one of my biggest motivators in dance and after he was arrested I just didn’t have the spirit to dance anymore. I recently started up again because of my friend Kern, and finding my style and “groove” has been a tough experience. My style before (when my body was smaller and lighter) was more quick and technical, however now that I am bigger and lankier it has been almost impossible to go back to how I was. Recently I have joined my school’s African dance/step team and  taken up Bboying (also known as breakdancing).  ","Because of breaking I was able to connect with fellow breakers at a benefit show my school dance team put on for a fellow breaker named Rocky that had recently passed. At the benefit show, many of his old breaking crews/students came to dance and pay tribute. Together we put on a show that not only touched Rocky’s family, but even those in the crowd that didn’t even know Rocky. At the show as I watched onlookers breakdown as we danced and saw Rocky’s girlfriend, who hadn’t smiled since his death, get excited and happy, I had a realization. Dance, like language, was meant to connect us. All our pains, cheers, thoughts, and differences are shared. I could feel the crowd connect on a level with me and my fellow dancers. I have rarely felt as happy as I did that night. That night I really felt like world peace is possible if we just learned to understand each other like everyone in that gym understood each other. I’m glad I danced, because for one night I was able to help alleviate the pain and sadness of bboy Rockybot’s death. ","Because of dance I don’t worry as much as others because as a dancer I don’t treat people like others do. In the dance community you don’t worry about race, religion, appearance, or history. I am who I am through how I dance and no one can take that away from me.         ","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.","During the summer after my Freshman year I was given the opportunity by my counselor to pilot a new summer chemistry class. Having anticipated that I might not get to take AP Chemistry during the regular school year, I took the opportunity of piloting the new summer chemistry class the summer of my freshman year. Even though this was a great opportunity, the summer chemistry class hardly prepared me for what was to come. Although I was unable to fully grasp all of the rules and intricacies of Chemistry in the short time I was given in the summer class, I was able to learn how to use T-charts, the main elements used on the periodic table, how to read a periodic table, and most importantly how covalent and ionic bonds are formed. When I started AP Chemistry during the school year I did not understand concepts which I was supposed to have already covered in regular chemistry. Also, in a sense, I was a sophomore in junior/senior class, so there was really no other student in the class that I could bravely seek help from. I could tell the teacher was becoming frustrated with my lack of knowledge. I now see this adverse experience as a blessing. If I had not taken the summer chemistry class, I would never have been able to take AP Chemistry in high school and I would never have found out that I have the ability to teach myself. In the end I actually did end up passing both the AP Chemistry class and the AP test. ","        Looking back now The circumstances of the class helped me be both more outgoing self-driven., I was able to make friends with juniors and seniors that I still connect with today. I also had to teach myself and get my work done while also trying to learn from the teacher herself.","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?","Back when I was a freshman and even before that, basketball was my main focus.  However the injury to my knee changed all that. An MRI showed that the Articular Cartilage protecting my femur had torn off from forced trauma and now not only was their an unprotected spot that was allowing my femur to be damaged, but I also had a big piece of cartilage floating around in my knee scraping everywhere. Watching my dreams crumble around me was not an instantaneous thing. It started off as a shock to me, then my naivety set in making me believe that everything would return to the way it was. Healing was never a simple process for me, dates kept being pushed back. Two months turned  into 8 months, and on top of that rehabilitation didn’t go as planned, it ended up being almost a year before I could even jog again. I became depressed having no idea with what I was to do with myself. The hardest points were when I would watch other people play basketball and think that life wasn’t worth living anymore. School became extremely difficult because I literally lost the energy to do anything. When that would happen I would lay on the floor for hours staring at the ceiling. I think the hardest part of the injury was not the injury itself, but my mother's attempts at encouragement. She told me sorry and that I should move on, but never that I could do it. Unable to find encouragement in others I had to really look deep into myself. Regardless of what the injury did to me, it did teach me to slow down. The life of a child athlete is a fast-paced one, however my knee injury changed my course. It was difficult however it allowed me to figure what I’m allowed to do and taught me that sometimes as humans we need to take time to “heal” whether it's emotionally, physically, mentally, or spiritually. It taught me that if you want encouragement, you have to close your eyes and summon it for yourself. It took me till the end of my sophomore year to realize this, and through this school has gotten easier and I have been able to learn so much more."]},{"id":"1r8ew9nXGwUbRhOPiG2tDE62y_5ZYRLLwBE6n1jKg_SI","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"waitlisted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"","paragraphs":["What have you done to make your school or community a better place?","I was selected out of twenty students to represent my school for a week at a summer camp called RYLA. I was very nervous attending the camp as I soon found out I was one of four African American people at the camp. Being as optimistic as possible, I absorbed as much from the camp as possible. I learned from the camp that positivity, confidence and perseverance are key tools to leading a successful life. Taking my three lessons back to my home in Sacramento, I went to volunteer at a basketball facility. I was put in the situation of working with an autistic young boy named Emmanuel. Emmanuel played basketball to release some of his energy and anger from home. Working with Emmanuel was important to m, being that I have my own special needs brother and I know it takes a little longer for people with special needs to learn. Emmanuel took longer to understand the new drills we did daily. For me it took a lot of patience to help Emmanuel because I’m familiar with playing fast paced basketball. Taking what I learned from the RYLA camp, I tried to instill confidence and positivity in him. I always encouraged him to keep trying at every drill as hard as he could and made sure to gave him positive feedback. When Emmanuel made a mistake, I ensured him it was okay to make mistakes and focused on the solution to fix future mistakes. Working with Emmanuel has motivated me to invest in my own sports facility when I get older. I want my facility to focus on special needs children and helping them get active, because many times special needs children never get the chance to participate in sports because of their lack of confidence. By working with Emmanuel, I was finally able to understand some of the problems and thinking processes my own brother has by seeing it from a different perspective. Working with Emmanuel was a life changing and humbling experience.","Describe an example of you leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time. "," ","In eleventh grade, my leadership class lost control. The new teacher running the class was poorly organized, and many of the students were seniors who joined for the looks of it and not interested in actually doing the required work. It was clear from the start we were going to have problems. During homecoming week, the events were not being successfully executed, so I took matters into my own hands. I explained to my leadership class that we had lost respect and we needed to prove our worth. I encouraged my leadership class to set their differences aside and think about school as a whole. The day of the rally, not enough decorations were made, so I broke the class into groups and each had their own jobs. During rally practice, I made sure everything was fully executed from the games, to performers, to transition times. In the end, the entire school gym was decorated from top to bottom. I hosted the rally, and the entire school had a great time. I received positive feedback from the administration. I also had to step up and actually address the problems while finding solutions to fix them. From that point forward, I greatly improved the efficiency of the class and quality of our events for the rest of the year. I learned that sometimes not all people have the same drive as I do, but it’s important to focus on my job, delegate specific jobs, and work hard.","Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it influenced you? ","         ","Change will only come if we as future leaders gain roles of positions that will lead to greater change. A future in business will allow me to create direct avenues of change and become one of the most successful business owners in the world. Throughout high school, I was exposed to classes in which  I learned about types of businesses, running businesses, and marketing products. Beyond the theory, the most important things I learn from taking business classes has come from interacting with my classmates as we run an actual business. Throughout these experiences, I learned that patience is essential because not everyone will work as efficiently as I do. Patience has played a strong role in helping me to ensure that our programs and initiatives run smoothly. Working with different students showed me that working with friends is not always smart and stereotyping others limits what their potential. Taking business has definitely motivated me more to work in the business field because it was exciting to work on an actual business where we design and sell t-shirts for our school community. I am the VP of Sales and Marketing, and I love it because I am a competitive person who is strong at communicating and advertising.  I narrowed the areas of business I want to work in to marketing, finance, and management. I have also become interested in working with international business because it is fun to explore new people and their cultures. Business is definitely a challenge, since I was not aware of the amount of work it took to maintain a businesses until I was running one of my own. I was awakened to the fact that many people run their businesses for money and not to help better society. Personally, I want to run multiple businesses that help the community. Giving back to the community through business is important because without the community, businesses would not be able to function. Additionally, I would like to help underprivileged and underrepresented communities because I know that business opportunities play a huge part in transforming low income communities. ","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?","It seemed as if misery and misfortune began to arise as I entered my sophomore year. My grandmother suddenly got very sick very quickly and my brother was struggling with his ongoing mental illness. Due to my grandmother’s illness, my mom had to shift most of her time to taking care of my grandmother and making sure she received the proper care. Unfortunately, my grandmother passed away a couple of weeks before my AP World History test. My brother’s schizophrenia, affecting his behavior in new ways everyday, was hard to balance. Between visiting my brother forty-five minutes away from home and making sure my grandmother was in good care an hour and a half from home, life seemed to completely turn upside down. At this point in my life, it looked as if it was over, but I realized that life still goes on. This was one of the most difficult adversities I had to experience which caused my effort and perseverance in class to diminish. There were days when I did not want to be at school. I did all my research on other high schools in Sacramento, as if leaving my school would solve all my problems. I learned the hard way that trying to leave the school would not solve any of my problems at all. Finally, my AP test and finals came, and I performed poorly on both. I was devastated. However, my sophomore year prepared me to successfully transition into my junior year, because I improved as a student both mentally and socially. I took the initiative to enroll for more AP classes and also made a commitment to score well in them. After my hard work, I finished my junior year with a 3.86 unweighted and a 4.46 weighted. I passed my AP U.S. History exam with a five, and by signing up for the many programs, I was able to participate in all of them. Everything started with one failure that allowed the hardest year of my life to lead to the best year of my life."]},{"id":"1v0sLTTOxbsReV_TX5-MFg6VpoQTe2WWGTfiAZw7q2TE","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"","paragraphs":["Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.  ","A meaningful example of where I displayed a  leadership is when I positively influenced my peers during a college tour to Atlanta. To rally my fellow students to complete their UC applications, I encouraged  my friends to diligently work to improve their applications day and night. My peers and I would edit each other’s applications. As some students tend to be irresponsible, many of the students failed to submit their essays before the deadline. I took the initiative to contact the students who had not submitted their essays and requested that they send them in immediately. When it came to the day to find out who had got in, two of my friends and I ended up getting in. We ended up being three of the twenty-four students from across the country that got selected. This is one of the most impactful moments I have been able to create. Taking the initiative, ensuring that my peers were given a chance to be accepted into the program, proved to be a extremely rewarding experience.","When it comes to being a leader, I’m the type that will always try to give you that extra push for greatness. Before helping my friends for the college tour, I had many different leadership encounters with other students at my high school.I push my teammates at Football practice to do their best, so when it comes to game day all of that hard work will show and pay off. I always encourage my peers to excel in  school. When they don’t understand something with their school work, I am  always there for them, because i want to see them graduate and succeed in life just like me. ","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?","After having these different encounters with my friends, it really showed me how much of a leader I can be in my community,and how much of a influence I have on others. As the years go by, I can see what a great leader I am becoming, ","I grew up homeless and had little to nothing, in and out of homeless shelters and forced to wear the same ragged outfits to school every week.  My Brother, Sister, and I were eating rice and beans every night and whatever else my mom can get with the little money she had. My mother and step- father struggled to make ends meet. When we had to leave the homeless shelters, we would have to go to run down hotels where it was so cold when I woke up in the morning the water i left out was frozen solid. ","Through all my trials and tribulations  I was still able to remain at the  top of my class, because I felt that  my education should come first. I didn't want my upbringing to be an excuse to why I couldn't succeed I did not allow my circumstances to limit my expectations and aspirations. I didn't want my future Family living like I did; not knowing where they would be living the next day. So when I got to the shelter or when I was on the bus I  would study and work on homework, and help my younger siblings so they could know how important and powerful knowledge is. I believe having a high level of education is greater than money, and can get you anywhere you want in life. This had an huge affect on my academic achievements, because if I was able to be top of my class then I can do it now. Today I am on track to being a Student Athlete Valedictorian. ","All in all, although we may not be able to control the obstacles we face in life, we must strive for excellence by holding firmly to our goals, beliefs, and aspirations. ","What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?  ","Something I have done to make my community a better place was going to the local Elementary school to mentor underprivileged and disadvantaged 2nd graders who resided in my community. The kids and I built  very strong bonds, because most of them grew up in the same situation as I did. Many of them were raised in broken families, violent homes and communities full of drugs and weaponry. Many of them struggled to find an avenue to escape the conditions to which we were subject for a way out, just as I did.","During their recess, I would pull kids aside and talk to them and see what problems they were going through.Many of them confided in me and knew that I would be there to consult them.  For most of the kids I was the only person they could talk, trust, and relate to. One of my mentees was named Ryon. Before I started mentoring him he would fight everyday in response to his experiences as a bully victim. ,By the end of the school year he was no longer fighting,  because I was able to mediate  a conversation between Ryon and the bullies. . Ryon stopped getting kicked out of class, and began volunteering in class more, as he became more eager to learn new class material.","I had the opportunity to witness Ryon transform into a responsible, diligent and hard working student that became one of the top students in his class.I will continue to mentor and serve as many students as possible in order to ensure that children of disadvantaged and underprivileged communities have access to resources that will allow one to succeed despite one's unbearable circumstances. There are so many other kids just like Ryon who desire to learn develop and succeed but lack the resources and support to do so. I will stand in the gap and continue to guide students into successful paths. ","Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?","Growing up in an all white school, I was the black  kid  who was treated like the “other” in the room. I got little help from teachers and told that I wouldn’t make it to college. I was told that  I was going to be held back and sent to another school.  Instead of letting this discourage me, I used that to push me         whenever I thought of quitting. The next school year I was passing all of my state tests and ended up on honor roll. I believe this separates me from others because when life begins to get hard I always think back to where I came from and how I have to keep excelling so my younger siblings know they can make it out of poverty. I believe if I don't lead by example for my siblings, they won't excel and believe in themselves. ","A times when I had a big challenge in front of me and let in discourage me was when my football team played Stagg High School. The game was back and forth, and a lot of players on my team were getting injured. During the second quarter, I had hurt my ankle along with the other running back who had hurt his ankle as well. With us being short on player I went and changed my cleats and got back in the game. With us being down by two touchdowns many of my teammates felt discouraged and ready to go home, but it was my responsibility to encourage those on my team. I’ve always been the high spirited person who will never give up no matter the circumstances. After talking to different members of the team and getting them pumped up , when the fourth quarter came we went down and took the lead once again by a touchdown. When the game ended we walking out with the win that had carried with us for the rest of the season.","These are just two prime examples of when I faced difficult challenges and didn’t let them discourage me, but instead was able to fight through them despite my circumstances. Throughout my life I always said “We can’t change the cards god has dealt us in life, so make the best out of the hand we’ve been dealt."]},{"id":"1vhVxoF8Jf967PWM3kZtURjOxAHzDd6-cRdZev90Kb40","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"","paragraphs":["Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement? ","My significant challenge I faced was my parent's divorce. My mom and step dad divorced in my sophomore year of high school. My stepdad has been a father figure since the day he married my mom, when I was in the fifth grade. I was raised with not knowing my biological father, and never had a father for support while growing up. In the end of my sophomore year, they had a messy divorce and stopped communicating. I did not want my younger sister growing up without a father support as I did, so I took initiative in fixing their problems. I would communicate for both of them in order to schedule who takes care of Kasandra, and how bills are going to be paid. Soon after my mom lost her job. We had no money to pay for bills, rent, and food. I started working in order to help out with bills. I worked as many hours as possible in order to be able to help my mom pay the bills.On the days I did not work I would baby sit Kasandra, so my mom could take an extra shift at work since we could not afford a babysitter. We did not have family around either to help out with taking care of Kasandra, my little sister. Balancing work, school, and babysitting became challenging. I lost hope in believing I was going to be successful in school. I felt alone because no one in my family was there to support me with school. Only six people in my family had graduated from high school and none of them were able to help. I sought for help in my school. During lunch, I would stay in for tutoring with different teachers to be able to keep up with all my school work. I joined Trio for after school tutoring on the days I did not babysit or work. I excelled at school with the help of tutoring. I struggle with family and school as well and have difficulty focusing in school. I wanted to help others because without help I would not have been able to overcome my challenge, so I started tutoring others during lunch.","Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you.","My favorite academic subject is Spanish. The reason being Spanish was my first language. Spanish not only became a way to connect with family, but it also became part of my identity. I wanted to be able to help others who did not have the opportunity to learn English or Spanish. My junior year of high school, I joined Spanglish Club. I wanted to be able to help others in school, as I do at home by translating for family members. In Spanglish Club, I had the opportunity to teach English to students who did not have the opportunity to learn English in their family or school. Also, I taught Spanish to Latinx students who only were English speakers only. I taught Spanish to break the barrier and distance of not being able to embrace and be part of their own culture. During the Summer, I took an Ethnic Studies at Evergreen Valley College. The course was to learn about Mexican/ American studies. This helped me to learn more about where I come from and to fully understand my identity. Spanish to me is more than just a subject, it's a way of life. Spanish is part of my culture and I learned to communicate and understand my culture through Spanish. I became part of an Aztec dancing group. I was able to connect with more bilingual speakers and learn more about where my ancestors come from and another side of history that is not taught in History Class. Spanish helped me embrace and find my identity. Spanish expanded my horizon and has allowed me to help others connect with their culture and embrace bilingualism.","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced. ","A significant education opportunity is getting accepted to got accepted into CDC. The CDC program is a nine-month long course funded by Comcast. The purpose of this program is to teach money management, hardware, coding, and public speaking skills to everyone who got accepted in the community. I have always had an interest in technology and business, but I could not afford the cost of a program like this. Throughout the program, I got the opportunity to network with different companies such as Lyft, Twitter, and NetApp. This program taught me about different tech companies and helped me expand the different tech industries and learn new coding and computer skills through hands on experience. Through this program, I was able to network with many people in the tech industry in this program, I was able to learn how to take apart and put together a console. through this program, I found an interest in coding, was able to learn about HTML, and started designing my own business website. I learned everything this program had to offer and from this program, I was able to do a Latino Leadership Program by being invited by the Professor. This program gave me the opportunity to help small businesses by expanding their business profiles. One of the businesses I worked with was Little Angels Family Daycare. Coming from a low-income family, I never imagined I would be able to help others. I was extremely fortunate to be accepted into free programs that gave me the opportunity to explore business and technology.Learning from my own experience, I realized without help I would have never been able to participate in these programs so I decided to teach others about technology, such as coding."," What have you done to make your school or your community a better place? ","I pride myself in being able to give back to my community and school by teaching English to Spanish speakers and Spanish to English Speakers. My junior year of highschool I  learned of the opportunities many people do not have because of the language they speak. To help others, I joined the Spanglish club. The Spanglish club was a club at my school that taught English and Spanish to whoever wanted to learn more of that language. The meetings were every Wednesday during lunch in which I would teach English to Juan Mora. Juan understood some English, but was very shy to speak in English due to his accent. After, the first month of the Spanglish club, both Juan and I realized one hour a week was not enough time to learn English. We decided to meet after school as well, for twice a week from 4 pm-7:30pm. I was able to teach Juan English enough till he felt comfortable speaking to others in English. This was important for me to teach Juan because that was his last year of high school knowing little English is difficult finding a job in any industry. Teaching Juan and many other members of the Spanglish Club English and Spanish has helped them to be able to communicate, translate, and understand others better. I took joy in having the opportunity to give back to my community. Through the CDC program, I was able to help small local businesses with latino owners learn more about how put their business on the web. I enjoy helping my community which is why starting next week I am going to help small local business expand their business by creating a website, yelp account, g suite, domain, and google location consulting, and more. I am going to be able to help my community by being part of the Summer Youth Latino Leadership Program."]}]
