","As one of the few African American males enrolled in my high school, I feel a strong need to create a helpful and positive community for minority students that look like me. Through this need, I have taken on the position of Vice President with my school’s Black Student Union. As a third year officer of the Black Student Union, I have contributed to my club's efforts to provide a positive community and give back to others over a long period of time. Every year other BSU official and I are large parts of the program. I help put together everything that happen in the club. Recently, I was put in charge of officer polos. I did everything from collecting officer shirt sizes, designing the shirts, to ordering the shirts from the printing company. This year I was also put on the Club Day Team. I got to work with other members of the Black Student Union to put  together a table and an activities board, showing off our club to possible new members. I was allowed to design the board, decorate the table, and reach out to other minorities by passing out club flyers. During the holiday’s, the Black Student Union often puts on special holiday activities, my favorite of which is Thanksgiving baskets. Last Thanksgiving, me and one other member of the program were in charge of the junior class food item donation. I reached out to many of my fellow junior class mates at the time to ultimately win class to bring in the most items. But more importantly, the Black Student Union was able to supply nine families with thanksgiving dinners who may not have had one without such donations. Through the events and activities mentioned above, along with many more examples requiring dedication and commitment, I have  gained many valuable experiences helping me to see the effects of such commitment and to contribute to the Black Student Union for over three years.","What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?","My greatest talent is playing basketball. Growing up as an active child, I played multiple sports, but I always enjoyed basketball most of all. At first, I️ appreciated the social aspect of the sport. All I needed was a ball, a basket and a friend. Later, I grew to love the competition. Everyone wants to be the best player with the best team and the most wins. I love how if I am willing to put forward time and effort, I can become better than these opponents. As a child, my father told me to “stick to football” because I was no good at basketball, but this only encouraged me to become better at the sport that I loved. I play on an elite travel basketball team based out of Santa Ana, which is two and a half hours away from my hometown. In the last year, my team and I have traveled to places like Indianapolis and Las Vegas, and I️ have played against multiple top Division I recruits. I have come from being told to pick a new sport, to now having the opportunity to travel the nation based on my athletic abilities, but it took plenty of hard work and dedication to get to where I am today. I have sacrificed countless hours to a gym for practice, or just to get extra shots up. I have sacrificed friendships and other relationships due to lack of time or conflict in interest. I have sacrificed experiences, missing my school’s trip to France to play against one of the best travel teams in the world, Compton Magic. All of this sacrifice shows my dedication to developing my greatest talent. At the end of my junior year, my teammates selected me as the most valuable player of my varsity high school basketball team. Next year, I️ will continue to showcase my determination and will to improve by bringing the same characteristics I️ use in basketball to the college setting.","Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you.","In school, I find science to be the most enjoyable of all the subjects. I like science because it requires many different skills and it challenges me to understand the world around me. For example, last year I️ was enrolled in my favorite science class, Honors Physics, where my teacher not only taught me velocity equations, but challenged me further by requiring me to reading scientific plays and discussing science fiction topics. These activities, in their unorthodox approaches on science, furthered my passion for everything science stands for; like, understanding, answers, and problem solving. These are things that I wonder about on a daily basis. Unlike many other subjects, science usually works around real word problems. A science test question may ask how fire works or how gravity affects an object rather than how to solve an equation that can be calculated through a calculator. Science is not only my favorite subject, but it has affected how I go about my daily life. Science has influenced me to question the world around me like ancient scientists once did. To have new ideas that everyone may not accept. Question how something works, how it was made, what gives it its properties. Without questions there could not be answers. Science has taught me to reach toward understanding. I try to understand something and how it works rather than just memorize an equation or formula. This does not only pertain to school and learning, but to life. I try to understand a person before judging them, understand a situation before jumping to conclusions, even attempting to understand one's actions before committing to anger. So, as I️ continue on my journey through life and into college, I️ will take the lessons I️ learned from science into my everyday life, college field, and work place, by continuing to ask these question and continuing to reach for understanding. Science has not only been my favorite subject but it has influenced my life in many ways. This is why I love science.","What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?","This year I became a part of the 2017-2018 Ford Dream Builders. Ford Dream Builders is a very selective program, sponsored by the local Ford car dealership, geared toward building leadership skills and career readiness in high school students. We participate in multiple volunteering activities, along with being allowed to produce a large scale community service project by the end of my senior year. Of the many activities I have completed to better the community through Ford Dream Builders, I really enjoyed the “Spread the Love” event where I helped make over 500 peanut butter and jelly sack lunches for multiple local children’s organizations, including the Boys and Girls Club and the Police Activities League. For myself, I got to see, first hand, how people can come together to achieve a common goal. I found it very inspiring, when I took a step back, to see all of us working so hard to better our community and put a smile on children’s faces while we light-heartedly joked and laughed amongst each other. For myself and many others “Spread the Love” was fun and social, but at the same time I️ was helping to give meals to less fortunate children who may have gone without lunch if it weren’t for myself and others like me. I️ loved this feeling. With teamwork, communication, and a desire to help, I love how I can make a difference in my community or an individual's life and have an affect on something so much greater than myself. Through my sandwich making experience I️ plan to continue with this feeling. I️ will continue to help others, while aspiring to create a fun and positive atmosphere for others willing to help those in need. I️ also want to inspire not only my friends, but everyone to get out and feel the feeling I️ felt during “Spread the Love” by having a good time while bettering people's lives."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=182"},{"id":"1-2GBEjONzYRaWB_P_rQ2Edfa7g3eUceIqypPUntHmQo","featured":true,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"2018-10-04T19:56:04.182Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time. ","My story not only list all the important aspects of my life; it explains how these events define me as a person.  I want to make those who supported throughout my journey proud, especially my parents. I feel I have to prove to them I can make it in life because of the mistakes my older siblings have made.  So I feel this is important to me because I do not want to disappoint them for all the time and money they invested in me.  In addition, I want to set an example for my older and younger siblings to show them anything is possible with hard work.  I am determined to accomplish this goal by taking every opportunity possible to fulfill my dream."," I am an African American male so I have a slight disadvantage toward among my students in my class.  I always get inferior looks when I am the only African American male in my advanced classes.  I am intimidated to ask questions because I feel other classmates would mock my intelligence.  This affected my grade and caused me to get my first C in math.  I was devastated and almost switched into a College Preparatory class, but I didn’t.  I thought to myself what kind of person I would be if I were to quit.  I stayed in the class and worked extra hard to prove I belong in the class.  I also took this as a learning experience; nothing is handed to you in life, you have to work for it.  "," ","This mentality applies in sports as well.  I have played soccer for about eleven years and I love the game, despite all the negative feedback I have encountered.  When I first signed up, my uncle criticized me because soccer was not a sport that not a lot of black people played.  This criticism fueled my drive to exceed in the sport and become a dynamic player.  I started to play organized club soccer, competition is intense.  I was the only African American on a predominantly hispanic team, and their skills were sharp.  I had to train everyday outside of practice to match the skills of my teammates.  This meant staying after practice to run extra sprints, training in unbearable weather and sacrificing my social life to pursue what I love.  ","                    ","Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.  ","I have been involved in leadership programs in school and sports.  Last year, my counselor recommended me for a Youth Leadership program to represent the school.  If selected, we would be able to tour around Bakersfield studying the different economic industries.  I never seen myself as a leader.  When I was younger I was not very social and kept my feelings and emotions to myself.  It was always my mother who made plans for me and spoke on my behalf.  It got so bad that I cannot even express myself to my own father, who always told me to be my own person and communication was key.  Eventually I had to break this bad habit when I wanted to switch high schools.  It was very stressful but we came to an agreement.  After that moment, I started to become more vocal in expressing myself to people and it had a profound impact on my social life.  I began to understand my father was right about communication and how it defines you as a person.  Even though my application was not accepted, I took this as a learning experience.  I wouldn't have been recommended for this if I did not show any leadership qualities so I feel I have the skills of being a responsible leader.","                      My leadership skills play a significant role in sports as well.  I wasn’t a vocal person so communicating to my teammates was difficult.  Since I was not able to communicate, it was difficult to manage the game.  As a result, it lead to a rough season of losses due.  It was tough seeing my teammates give up, so I decided next season was going to be different.  In one of our practices, I stepped out of my comfort zone and forced myself to communicate and it turned out very effective.  I began to incorporate this into our games and it resulted in our team winning league.  Even though I wasn’t an official captain, I was viewed as a resilient leader.","Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom. ","My favorite academic subject will always be math.  I love problem solving and being able to figure them out on my own.  I feel I acquired the love for math from my father because he loves figuring things out by himself and will never be satisfied until it is solved, no matter how long it takes.  Since math came natural to me, I was arrogant and did not need any help figuring out problems.  Also, I always got A’s and B’s in all of my math classes so I never needed help.  This mentality was pretty evident in my Precalculus class when I had got my first C.  So I came to the realization that asking for help doesn’t make me incompetent to solve problems.    ","I love math because it pertains to the potential career I want to pursue in.  My first career option is Mechanical Engineering.  I was intrigued by the hands-on part of the job, the problem-solving aspect and the numerous amount of mathematics involved.  In addition, the applications of this career varies so you are not limited to a specific job.  I was also fascinated by this career because I want to create something that is beneficial to my community.  I am not as involved in my community as I should be, but I do as much as I can to provide for it.  I volunteer through Frito-Lay and we donate to people less fortunate.  Every year, Frito-Lay does a backpack drive at a local Boys and Girls Club and we donate about 100 backpacks with various amount of school supplies to kids who cannot afford the simple essentials.  It makes me feel good to volunteer to help people in different communities.  I feel they look up to me for making an impact on their communities, no matter how big or small. ","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.        ","My open-mindedness has helped me take advantage of various opportunities and resources presented to me.  I am always happy to broaden my scope with new options that are beneficial to my future.  It was not until my sophomore year that I started to express myself and become more vocal.  In turn, I became more involved in BSU and developed a close relationship with my advisor.  She then recommended me for the Experience Berkeley program.  She informed me that Berkeley was looking to raise its diversity rate by reaching out to minority group who meet the exceptional qualifications they were looking for.  So I filled out the application and I got accepted.  I did not have a clue about the admission process and how fast the deadline was approaching.  However, my mentor at Berkeley helped by simplifying everything to ensure that I understood everything.  I am glad I took this opportunity because I got a headstart on the admission process and information about college that I would have never figured out on my own.  In addition, I am grateful I was given this opportunity because raises my chances in getting into a college and making my parents proud."," I am the first to take initiative when it pertains to success in my future.  For instance, I love the game of soccer and want to pursue it after high school, so I do everything in my power to make sure I turn that dream in a reality. It was not until the beginning of junior year that I learned about how to get a soccer scholarship.  I had to email coaches of the colleges I was interested in and make online recruiting accounts.  I could not afford to go to many of the college camps I wanted to go to, so I was upset that I was missing an opportunity to meet with coaches face-to-face.  However, I got feedback from a lot of coaches I contacted and I was ecstatic because I am equipped to play at a college level and now my dreams are turning into a reality."],"tag":"featured","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=646"},{"id":"11K0GFO3tWzQaahpmjZREFeGh-y4bUclPkbVU5x6kp7I","featured":"","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"Maryland","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T04:15:23.063Z","image":"","paragraphs":["And on that Note","The sound was loud and discordant, like a hurricane, high notes and low notes mixing together in an audible mess. It was as if a thousand booming foghorns were in a shouting match with sirens. Unlike me, this was a little abrasive and loud. I liked it. It was completely unexpected and extremely fun to play.","Some instruments are built to make multiple notes, like a piano. A saxophone on the other hand doesn’t play chords but single notes through one vibrating reed. However, I discovered that you can play multiple notes simultaneously on the saxophone. While practicing a concert D-flat scale, I messed up a fingering for a low B-flat, and my instrument produced a strange noise with two notes. My band teacher got very excited and exclaimed, “Hey, you just played a polyphonic note!” I like it when accidents lead to discovering new ideas.","I like this polyphonic sound because it reminds me of myself: many things at once. You assume one thing and get another. At school, I am a course scholar in English, but I am also able to amuse others when I come up with wince evoking puns. My math and science teachers expect me to go into engineering, but I’m more excited about making films. Discussing current events with my friends is fun, but I also like to share with them my secrets to cooking a good scotch egg. Even though my last name gives them a hint, the Asian students at our school don’t believe that I’m half Japanese. Meanwhile the non-Asians are surprised that I’m also part Welsh. I feel comfortable being unique or thinking differently. As a Student Ambassador this enables me to help freshman and others who are new to our school feel welcome and accepted. I help the new students know that it’s okay to be themselves.","There is added value in mixing things together. I realized this when my brother and I won an international Kavli Science Foundation contest where we explained the math behind the Pixar movie “Up”. Using stop motion animation we explored the plausibility and science behind lifting a house with helium balloons. I like offering a new view and expanding the way people see things. In many of my videos I combine art with education. I want to continue making films that not only entertain, but also make you think.","A lot of people have a single passion that defines them or have a natural talent for something specific. Like my saxophone I am an instrument, but I can play many notes at once. I’m a scholar and a musician. Quiet but talkative. An athlete and a filmmaker. Careful but spontaneous. A fan of Johnny Cash and Kill The Noise. Hard working but playful. A martial artist and a baker. One of a kind but an identical twin.","Will polyphonic notes resonate in college? Yes. For instance, balancing a creative narrative with scientific facts will make a more believable story. I want to bring together different kinds of students (such as music, film, and English majors) to create more meaningful art. Understanding fellow students’ perspective, talents, and ideas are what build a great community.","I’m looking forward to discovering my place in the world by combining various interests. Who I am doesn’t always harmonize and may seem like nothing but noise to some. But what I play, no matter how discordant, can be beautiful.

","Being a SOAR Ambassador has been one of the most satisfying high school activities for me thus far. Mentoring students empowers me to be an engaging leader; I have learned to blend their unfamiliarity with my experience. My desire to become a SOAR Ambassador is that no one in my home knew how to help me in school, and I want to provide my knowledge to the kids who are like me and need guidance and help. I was entrusted with six students, three each year; each attempting to find themselves, in this dual-enrollment high school and college setting. I am a leader to these girls, and I love it because I'm influencing them to be smarter, stronger, and better altogether. At the request of one mentee, I helped her plan her next four years of high school and guide her on how to get an AA degree. That plan I made for her turned into a form, that I created for the entire school to use, to plan out how to get an AA if desired. On another occasion, I helped tutor my mentees in math and their skills and scores improved. In a survey assessing mentors, my mentees reported that I was doing exceptionally well as their mentor, and along with other successful mentors, we were rewarded with tickets to a UCLA Bruins basketball game. The skills that generated the positive feedback on the survey were my planning, communication, and caring, which I express amongst my mentees. I expressed these skills by tutoring them, helping their time-management by planning, and listening to them. My mentees are now better prepared for the rest of high school and I continue to do this even today. My traits as an overachieving student are blending into these kids, and I can see how I'm affecting my school community positively by contributing to the success of the kids who want to achieve things in life. This experience is teaching me what it means to be a leader and gives me purpose to engage in programs where I can give back to my community.","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.","Applying and being accepted into SOAR High School, an early college high school, located on the Antelope Valley Community College campus, has been the biggest educational advantage I've taken. In this program students are concurrently enrolled in high school and college for all four years. It allows kids an opportunity to achieve an AA degree or complete IGETC transfer requirements. By the time I graduate I will have 60 units in college, two associate degrees, and completion of the honors program at AVC. The college courses and textbooks are paid for through an agreement between SOAR High School and AVC, and it is an amazing opportunity to take college classes while in high school. Joining this high school program was a great significant educational opportunity because I am making a contribution to my education and my future, along with my participation in clubs and community service. Making this decision was huge because I sacrificed a regular comprehensive high school experience; we are a small school community, with about 400 students, no sports and few clubs. I had to be mature enough to handle the dual enrollment. I was ready to take on this program because I knew this program would be an amazing educational opportunity. From the experience I learned to be more mature and it has prepared me for a University.","On top of SOAR itself, joining the honors program at AVC is another significant educational opportunity in addition to my original goal of graduating from AVC and SOAR. It is a challenge for me because it is extra coursework on top of the regular college course requirements. My honors classes consist of many intriguing class discussions, research papers, and heavy communication with professors. With this honors program, six of my 60 college course units will receive honors college credit, making me an honor certified student. Doing the honors program at AVC has shaped me with integrity, maturity, and ambition. ","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?","Beginning in the 5th grade, I started having migraines, and they came twice a week with throw up. I had problems concentrating and getting work done because my head would be thumping with massive pain, and it created a massive amount of stress, as it challenged my perseverance. I began seeing a neurologist, taking on-set medication, all while dealing with tests, quizzes, and lectures on top of the pain. Starting freshman year of high school, I had migraines every day lasting throughout the day. Six month visits with my neurologist and prescribed daily medication became a way of life for me, until the migraines returned. The next treatment was an intravenous therapy session, which failed, and then another daily medication that gave me ALL the listed reactions and caused me to be bedridden. Following the sickness I began having massages from the waist up for the pain and fortunately my migraines were completely eliminated. ","During this entire time I've dealt with migraines, it's been hard to stay at school and focus with such pain, but I do, because I feel school is very important and as long as the pain is tolerable to an extent, I manage. The times I've happened to miss school, I never allowed myself to fall behind, regardless of my pain; I would get my work done. It really challenged me to be 100% when my body only felt 50%, but I managed because my dedication is to my education. I got through by getting healthy with good eating habits, a good sleep routine, and learning to manage my stress. I had to ensure my eating habits included three meals a day, always breakfast, snacks, and plenty of water. The other adjustment was in my sleep patterns to determine the amount of hours of sleep necessary to feel at my best. It taught me how to manage my pain and stress by putting forth a mindset to cover for the temporal lack of physical strength within me. In overcoming this challenge, I learned that I can conquer anything impeding my academic achievement. ","Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?","As a driven and intelligent Latina, I've proven to myself and others that I will not accept the same environment I was raised in and simply accept it, but instead I'm fighting to live and become better than the circumstances I was brought up in. I've grown up with a binge drinker dad and a mother who loves to gamble at casinos. When my dad binge drinks, for weeks at a time, my mom will go to the casino and leave me with whoever will watch me till she gets back. My parents provide and care for me, but during these times, I feel invisible, and it hurts my mental state and affects my ability to focus on my education. During the times when I couldn't go home I learned to arrange my life so that my home situation didn't interfere with school. I had to keep track of what needed to be in my backpack to make sure I'd be able to do my schoolwork while my parents decided to not act as parents. I had to grow up quickly to be able to take care of myself as best as I could with my living circumstances. Despite having no parents to care for me in those bad moments, I took this time to make a life of my own and create a resilient personality in myself. I've managed to maintain great grades in a challenging school, care for myself, be involved in my community, and next May, I will graduate from high school with my diploma and a week later, I'll graduate from community college with two AA degrees. I didn't let anything or anyone stop me since childhood, although I lived this lifestyle I promised myself I wouldn't let this be my future. I believe my experience sets me apart because few students are able to change the trajectory of their life at such a young age. What I learned is that I control my education, which determines my future."],"tag":"popular","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=94"},{"id":"13xdbn541CKCKGiO3pjMX8PnDtAo3WSj1Ku-tydzCRhc","featured":"","prompt":"Common App","college":"","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2018,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T06:04:49.677Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Smeared blood, shredded feathers.

My response is framed around the ideas of Plato’s “Allegory of the Cave.”","Q: Why did the chicken cross the road?","A: A manicured green field of grass blades cut to perfectly matched lengths; a blue expanse ornamented with puffy cotton clouds; an immaculately painted red barn centered exactly at the top of a hill--the chicken gazes contentedly at his picturesque world. Within an area surrounded by a shiny silver fence, he looks around at his friends: roosters pecking at a feast of grains and hens lounging on luxurious cushions of hay. As the nice man in a plaid shirt and blue jeans collects the hens’ eggs, the chicken feels an overwhelming sense of indebtedness to him for providing this idyllic lifestyle.","On a day as pristine as all the others, the chicken is happily eating his lunchtime meal as the nice man carefully gathers the smooth white eggs when it notices that the man has left one behind. Strangely located at the empty end of the metal enclosure, highlighted by the bright yellow sun, the white egg appears to the chicken different from the rest. The chicken moves towards the light to tacitly inform the man of his mistake. But then the chicken notices a jagged gray line on the otherwise flawless egg. Hypnotized and appalled, the chicken watches as the line turns into a crack and a small beak attached to a fuzzy yellow head pokes out. Suddenly a shadow descends over the chicken and the nice man snatches the egg--the baby chick--and stomps off.","The chicken--confused, betrayed, disturbed--slowly lifts its eyes from the now empty ground. For the first time, it looks past the silver fence of the cage and notices an unkempt sweep of colossal brown and green grasses opposite its impeccably crafted surroundings. Cautiously, it inches closer to the barrier, farther from the unbelievable perfection of the farm, and discovers a wide sea of black gravel.  Stained with gray stones and marked with yellow lines, it separates the chicken from the opposite field.","The curious chicken quickly shuffles to Mother Hen, who has just settled on to her throne of hay and is closing her eyes. He is sure that the always composed and compassionate chicken will help him make sense of what he’s just seen.","“Mother Hen, Mother Hen! I-I just saw one of those eggs, cracking, and there was a small yellow bird inside. It was a baby. Are those eggs that the nice man takes away babies? And that black ground! What is it?” the chicken blurts out.","Her eyes flick open. “BOK BOK! Don’t you ever dare speak of what you have seen again,” Mother Hen snaps in a low and violent whisper, “or all of this will be taken away.” Closing her eyes again, she dismisses the chicken.","Frozen in disbelief, the chicken tries to make sense of her harsh words. It replays the incident in its head. “All the food, the nice soft hay, the flawless red barn--maybe all of this isn’t worth giving up. Maybe Mother Hen is right. She just wants to protect me from losing it all.” The chicken replays the incident again. “But it was a baby. What if it was hers? She still wouldn’t care. She’s being selfish; all she cares about is this perfect life.” A final replay, and the chicken realizes and accepts that Mother Hen knows, has known, that the man is doing something wrong; yet she has yielded to the cruelty for her own comfort. A fissure in the chicken’s unawareness, a plan begins to hatch. The chicken knows it must escape; it has to get to the other side.","“That man in the plaid shirt is stealing the eggs from their mothers again,” the chicken thinks the next day as he unlocks the cage. Then the man reaches into the wooden coop, his back to the entrance. “Now!” At its own cue, the chicken scurries towards the opening and exits unseen. With a backwards glance at his friends, the chicken feels a profound sadness and pity for their ignorance. It wants to urge them to open their eyes, to see what they are sacrificing for materialistic pleasures, but he knows they will not surrender the false reality. Alone, the chicken dashes away.","The chicken stands at the line between green grass and black gravel. As it prepares to take its first step into the unknown, a monstrous vehicle with 18 wheels made of metal whizzes by, leaving behind a trail of gray exhaust. Once it regains its breath, it moves a few inches onto the asphalt. Three more speeding trucks stop its chicken heart.","“I can’t do this,” it says to itself. “These monsters are a sign. They’re telling me to go back. Besides, a few lost chicks aren’t so bad. The man’s not that evil. He gives us food, and a home.”","But the chicken dismisses the cowardly voice in its head, reminding itself of the injustice back in the deceptively charming prison. Over the next several hours, it learns to strategically position itself so that it is in line with the empty space between the tires of passing trucks. It reaches the yellow dashes. A black blanket gradually pushes away the glowing sun and replaces it with diamond stars and a glowing crescent. It reaches the untouched field.","With a deep breath, the chicken steps into the swathe, a world of tall beige grass made brown by the darkness. Unsure of what it may discover, it determines to simply walk straight through the brush, out on to the other side. For what seems like forever, it continues forward, as the black sky turns to purple, then blue, then pink. Just as the chicken begins to regret its journey, the grass gives way to a vast landscape of trees, bushes, flowers--heterogeneous and variable, but nonetheless perfect. In a nearby tree, the chicken spots two adult birds tending to a nest of babies--a natural dynamic of individuals unaltered by corrupt influence.","And then it dawns on him. It has escaped from a contrived and perverted domain as well as its own unawareness; it has arrived in a place where the pure order of the world reigns.","“I know the truth now,” it thinks to himself as the sun rises. “But here, in Nature, it is of no use. Back home, I need to try to foster awareness among my friends, share this understanding with them. Otherwise, I am as cruel as the man in the plaid shirt, taking away the opportunity to overcome ignorance.","“I must return now; I have to get to the other side."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=1054"},{"id":"1B7HY4UuH4z78QxJS9DtoJirBQwzxgpDzDJUn3XdvVwI","featured":"","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"Maryland","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T04:19:01.490Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Learning How to Play","The first board game I ever played was Disney Princess Monopoly against my mother. It was a shocking experience. My otherwise loving and compassionate mother played to win. Though she patiently explained her strategies throughout the game, she refused to show me any mercy, accumulating one monopoly after another, building house after house, hotel after hotel, and collecting all my money until I was bankrupt, despite my pleas and tears that I was her daughter and only five years old. I remember clearly the pain I felt from losing, but I remained eager to play and determined to one day beat her. Eventually, we left the princesses behind and graduated to the regular, then the deluxe, editions of Monopoly, and expanded to Rummikub. Every time we played, I carefully observed my mother’s moves and habits while considering my own options. Over the years, she continued to beat me in both games, but the contests became more competitive and my losses more narrow. Finally, at twelve, I won for the first time, at Rummikub no less, a game at which she claimed to be undefeated! I felt an overwhelming sense of pride, which was only magnified when I saw the same emotion in my mother’s face.","I learned so much from these games beyond the obvious. I learned how to lose, and win, graciously. I learned to enjoy the process, regardless of the outcome. I learned how to take cues from other people but think on my own, both creatively and strategically. I learned how to cope with failure and turn it into a lesson. I learned that true victory stems from hard work and persistence. And I learned that the strongest and most meaningful relationships are not based on indulgence but on honesty and respect.","This doesn’t mean that losses don’t sting. I was devastated when my hockey team lost the championship game by only one goal when I was the last one to control the puck. But I was still incredibly proud of my team’s cohesiveness, the fluid effort we put into the season, and my own contribution. More importantly, the camaraderie and support of my teammates is ongoing and something I will always cherish more than a win. I didn’t dwell over what could have been. Instead, I focused on what I was going to take with me into the next season.","This past summer, I had my first substantive work experience interning at the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, researching and writing about treatments and therapies. Working there was certainly not a game, but my strategy was the same: work hard, remain focused, be mindful and respectful of those around me, deal with the inevitable curveballs, and take constructive criticism to heart, all in pursuit of a meaningful goal. At first, I found it intimidating, but I quickly found my footing. I worked hard, knowing that what I took away from the experience would be measured by what I put into it. I studied my co-workers: how they conducted themselves, how they interacted with each other, and how they approached their respective jobs. I carefully reviewed redlines on my writing assignments, tried not to get discouraged, and responded to the comments to present the material more effectively. I absorbed the stories relayed by Parkinson’s patients regarding their struggles and was amazed at how empowered they felt by their participation in clinical trials. Through them, I discovered what it really means to fight to win. I have also come to understand that sometimes a game never ends but transforms, causing goals to shift that may require an adjustment in strategy.","My mother and I still regularly play games, and we play to win. However, the match is now more balanced and I’ve noticed my mother paying much more attention to my moves and habits and even learning a few things from me."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=1048"},{"id":"1BjKJhCFbnjeIeFOIrezGki9osn6V5HvH4UiSreofphU","featured":"","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"Maryland","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T04:51:26.541Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Looking Through a Wider Lens","What does it mean to be an advocate? I didn’t find the answer in any sort of textbook. Not the anatomy textbook that lay across the foot of my bed, filled with Post-Its and half-drawn diagrams. Nor the chemistry textbook that sat on top of it, covered in streaks of blue highlighter. Not even Principles of Biology, overflowing with illegible notes and loose worksheets, had the answer. Yet, in a few years, I will be promising to do just that: be the ultimate advocate for my patients.","My search for the answer began quite unintentionally. When I was initially recommended to serve on the Youth Council my junior year of high school, my perspective on civic engagement was one of apathy and a complete lack of interest. I couldn’t understand how my passion for the medical field had any correlation with serving as a representative for the students at my school and actively engaging within the political sphere. I knew I wanted to pursue a career as a physician, and I was perfectly content embracing the safety net of my introverted textbook world.","But that safety net was ripped wide open the day I walked through the sliding double doors of City Hall for my first Youth Council meeting. I assumed I would spend my hour flipping through flashcards and studying for next week’s unit test, while a bunch of teenagers complained about the lack of donuts in the student store. Instead, I listened to the stories of 18 students, all of whom were using their voices to reshape the distribution of power within their communities and break the structures that chained so many in a perpetual cycle of desperation and despair. While I spent most of my time poring over a textbook trying to memorize formulas and theorems, they were spending their time using those formulas and theorems to make a difference in their communities. Needless to say, that meeting sparked an inspirational flame within me.","The next Youth Council meeting, I asked questions. I gave feedback. I noticed what the students at my school were really struggling with. For the first time, I went to drug prevention assemblies and helped my friends run mental health workshops. The more involved I became in my city’s Youth Council, the more I understood how similar being an advocate for your community is to being an advocate for your patients. When I volunteered at the hospital every week, I started paying attention to more than whether or not my patients wanted ice chips in their water. I learned that Deborah was campaigning for equal opportunity housing in a deeply segregated neighborhood and George was a paramedic who injured his leg carrying an 8-year-old with an allergic reaction to the Emergency Room. I might not have been the doctor who diagnosed them but I was often the one person who saw them as human beings rather than patients.","Youth Council isn’t something most students with a passion in practicing medicine chose to participate in, and it certainly wasn’t something I thought would have such an immense impact on the way I view patient care. As a patient’s ultimate advocate, a physician must look beyond hospital gowns and IV tubes and see the world through the eyes of another. Rather than treat diseases, a physician must choose to treat a person instead, ensuring compassionate care is provided to all. While I know that throughout my academic career I will take countless classes that will teach me everything from stoichiometry to cellular respiration, I refuse to take the knowledge I learn and simply place it on a flashcard to memorize. I will use it to help those whom I must be an advocate for: my patients."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=162"},{"id":"1CEb5K1bugd6TRzkFWhdAw3EKctCrRo4oEXjk_g3vPHU","featured":"","prompt":"","college":"Tufts University","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"Massachusetts","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T05:21:21.466Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Our Experimental College encourages current students to develop and teach a class for the Tufts community.

As I sat there, finishing up my second grade math homework, he greeted me with his trademark whimsical, yet tired, smile. His appearance:  a faded, worn-out shirt and durable, dusty jeans; his hands, caked with the grime and dirt that come with his line of work; his hair, on the verge of being assaulted with grey, covered in dust. After washing his hands, his greatest tools for his trade, he sat down with his reheated dinner, prepared by his loving wife forty minutes earlier. Without a word, he began to eat, aching for food after a long day of work. My second grade self couldn't help but notice the juxtaposition in play: a man in old, well-worn clothes, with dusty hair and hands not completely cleaned, dining in a room meticulously and somewhat ornately furnished, the fruit of his labor. We both sat there in silence. I could not help but look at my father the car mechanic in awe, considering where I myself might end up when I am his age.         ","\"Cessi, et sublato montes genitore petivi.\" I just have one final line in book two of Vergil's Aeneid, line 804. I gaze at the line for a moment before attacking it. I note how both \"sublato\" and \"genitore\" are ablative; they go together. I spot \"cessi,\" the verb meaning \"I yielded\", and \"petivi,\" which means \"I sought\". \"Montes\" in this scenario is in the accusative case, which means it is the direct object. I translate the line to, \"I yielded, and lifting my father I sought the mountains.\" I sat back, pleased with myself for finishing the second book of the renowned epic poem. Just then, my own father opened the door. Over dinner that night, we had another rousing talk regarding my looming college process. This talk was different, however; this was the night when I finally inform my dad of my intention to major in my favorite school topic, the classics. Upon hearing this news, my father's countenance was obscure, untranslatable.           ","When my parents were growing up in Ireland, an apprenticeship was far more valuable than college education. My parents did not attend college because apprentices got jobs sooner than those who went to college. Through apprenticeship my father got his first job. I realize the vast differences between my father's work and what I want to make my life's work. His is a realistic one: a job that was needed back then and is needed even more so today. It is a grueling work, in which one must use their hands and bodies to complete. Mine is perhaps less realistic. The classics once thrived; it was required curriculum at many private schools. The industry has only gone downhill since then, with fewer and fewer students taking the risk to learn the subject. It demands a high level of thinking, with much less physical requirements. Ultimately, I am grateful for my opportunity. My dad worked hard his entire life so that his own children got the chance to attend college to study and become what they want to be, and not what they needed to be for monetary reasons. My father is my hero for working hard, succeeding, and allowing me such a chance.         ","Despite his early doubt, when he soon learned that I did have a plan, which was that I wanted to teach the classics, my dad was at ease. That was all he needed to know. In my father's words, he said that if I had a plan that I was serious about, he would always fully support me. I was overjoyed by the fact that I, much like the pious hero Aeneas, would be able to carry my father, my past, with me toward my unknown future, rather than leave him behind, forever stuck in my past, a memory."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=768"},{"id":"1CLkLfuRv_ydMmxOU5zGLt6QpYckjq3rhsjlERGe15m0","featured":"","prompt":"","college":"Tufts University","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"Massachusetts","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T04:57:56.883Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Whether you've built blanket forts or circuit boards, created slam poetry or mixed media installations, tell us: What have you invented, engineered, produced, or designed? Or what do you hope to?","When problems arise, I solve them using copper fittings.","I first discovered this versatile building material as a seven-year-old visiting my father's HVAC shop. While waiting for him to finish working one night, I wandered from the modestly finished space at the front of the building to the shop in back, which featured high ceilings and imposing stacks of shelves. I was fascinated by the dusty machines with tubes, knobs, and old cracked nozzles. When Dad found me shoulder-deep in the scrap copper bin--which I later referred to as \"the world's coolest trash can\"--he determined that it was time to teach me to solder. Thirty minutes later, armed with a bowl haircut, a pair of safety glasses, and a healthy dose of self-confidence, I was ready to take on the world.","From then on, my childhood was a patchwork of failures. I fell into a constant cycle of thinking, designing, building, and rethinking. Common Christmas wish list items included drafting supplies and architectural stencils. Each childhood interest led me back to the shop, where I figured out a way to build it from copper fittings. Learning to play trombone inspired me to design my own instrument. After a faulty mouthpiece and soldering mistakes ruined three prototypes, \"The Plumbone,\" an instrument that could play three distinct notes, became my first successful creation. When a middle school acids and bases project called for building a paper maché volcano, I built a cannon instead. Though my first model failed to \"erupt,\" my second sprayed its contents so far that it left a swath of dead grass in my lawn. While the grass grew back, I built a soapbox car entirely out of copper and steel strut channel only to find myself claiming last place in the annual \"Soapbox Derby.\" Noting that the lightest cars accelerated quickest, I rebuilt my car, replacing steel with PVC pipe, and took second the next year. Having navigated around so many obstacles, I imagined that I could build anything so long as I had copper fittings.","As I matured, however, I began to drift away from my old standby. While attempting increasingly abstract projects, I grew frustrated by the limitations of copper fittings. It felt like the end of an era when I decided to build one last copper item, a small creature that I gifted to my dad. ","Leaving the familiarity of copper behind felt like entering a new, entirely foreign world. Embracing the freedom and uncertainty of Python, I began coding my newest idea: a game called \"Dive.\" While the concept proved exhaustingly ambitious, success seemed imminent as I stitched my project together, patch by patch. Yet when I looked through my computer one morning, I realized that \"Dive\" was gone, wiped inadvertently during a visit to the Apple store. I stared in disbelief at the blank computer screen, wondering if my vision was lost forever.","At this pivotal moment, I realized why copper fittings represent such an important part of my childhood. When my cannon refused to fire correctly, I learned something new about propulsion. When I soldered my instruments incorrectly, I refined my technique. Had I given up every time an idea failed, I would not have learned from my mistakes, and more importantly, I would not have found success. Even if I never solder again, the lessons I learned from copper fittings are the lessons that will guide me through life.","Losing \"Dive\" remains difficult to accept, yet excitement about the potential in a new game quickly overshadowed my disappointment. Years of faulty designs and unfortunate accidents have taught me to revise my methods, but not my goals, in the face of failure. With a confidence that only arises after realizing that success was just out of reach and finding the audacity to reach further, I set out to make \"Dive 2.0,\" the best game you'll ever play."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=1001"},{"id":"1CXUaseHkTqpWnDzRafrUS8GjCGSMu5zGfpsrzXl5mQ8","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"rejected","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"2018-10-04T19:55:06.760Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom. ","Critical thinking, problem-solving, and perseverance are just some of the skills taught by Math. I was taught math from a very young age which was when my love for math first began. I fell in love with math because it was vast and new. I knew math would be one the hardest to comprehend and I enjoyed the challenge of learning new things. Almost everything in life can be set up and solved in the same formula as a math problem.  Due to math I  built up tolerance and perseverance due to the repetition of solving similar math problems over and over again which helps me stay cool headed in annoying or challenging situations. No matter how simple a problem may seem math has taught me to not take shortcuts because you might move too fast and skip over a step and make a mistake. Math has also taught me how to check over myself in order to avoid mistakes, which ensures me to be as accurate and efficient as possible. I learned how to organize my time in the most efficient way from math. I can figure out how much time a task should take me to complete and which allows me to create and follow a schedule that employs the best use of my time. Math is used everyday in life such as counting money, reading the time, and even checking your phone's battery percentage. Math is more than just adding and subtracting numbers, it is one of the most important tools that I use to tackle some of the hardest problems and situations such as budgeting my money. I view math as a lifestyle especially because there are many types of maths that cover subjects such as statistics which studies chance, means and averages, all of which are important to real everyday life. This lifestyle has taught me how to be critical, hard-working, and tolerant and I would not be anywhere near as successful without math.","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.","I have involved myself with many different educational opportunities in order to prepare myself for college. The first step I took was joining AVID, a program recognized for preparing students for college. I joined AVID in the 7th grade. When I first joined AVID I hated AVID and thought that it was useless and pointless so I quit AVID in the 8th grade. I did so because I did not realize that while AVID felt as if it was not helpful, the work that was given and taught prepared you on how to be a successful College Student. I joined AVID again in the 9th grade because I decided to give it a second chance. In the 9th and 10th grades I still carried the same hateful attitude towards AVID, however, I stuck with AVID. In the 11th grade my attitude towards AVID  started to shift. And now Since being in AVID I have become more organized which was one of my major weaknesses before AVID. Besides being more organized, AVID has also helped guide me on the process of College applications and the FAFSA. Being in an AVID class with other AVID students have connected me with like minded students that push me harder and harder in order to be competitive with those students. My AVID class has bonded and grew closer and now we are a big family where everyone is accepted. Another opportunity to prepare myself for college was The PSAT. I took the PSAT starting my 8th grade year. The PSAT prepared me for the SAT by introducing me to SAT style questions and pointing out my strengths and weaknesses which told me what I needed to study. During my high school career, I have taken multiple Honors and AP classes which challenged and opened my way of thinking critically. Honors and AP classes are more rigorous which adds stress and  are more time consuming. These opportunities, as well as others, have put me on a path which has prepared me for college.","What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?  ","In my community I have made a difference in many ways that have created  positive impacts. At first  In my community, I was a boy scout. I was a member of Troop 118 and we underwent many programs to help the community. Being in Boy Scouts teaches morals and ethics to younger and older boys. One specific example of leadership I undertook was at a camp for the younger boy scouts. I volunteered as one of the older boy scouts which help the Scoutmaster watch the kids and make sure they are safe and protected. At school, I joined this program called MESA in which we tutor kids after school. This program helps those who are struggling in the area of math.  I volunteer at the library. Often times I am asked to teach the newer volunteers. In my home, I often run errands for my grandparents because they often don't have the energy to go shopping or to get food. Every Sunday I drive my grandma to church and back home. My grandma is involved with many programs in our church that involve youth and teens so without me driving her she would not be able to perform these actions. When we go grocery shopping, my grandma gives me the list and I go and grab the items off the list in the store. At church every Saturday I volunteer to clean up the church at 8 am. I am also apart of the Junior Usher Board for my church. Every 2nd and 5th Sunday we guide people to their seats and bring fans, programs, and envelopes. When I usher, I help preserve the order of the church and quickly get people into their seats so as to not cause a distraction. When I am not ushering, I help out in Children's Church and teach lessons to those in Children’s Church. These are some of the leadership roles I have had in my house, community, and school.","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge.

As an African American male, society typically places us at the bottom of the list. When I was young I witnessed my family act ghetto which led me to believe as a black male that how I was supposed to behave. Thus in elementary school I fell behind academically because I felt that since I was a black male I wasn’t supposed to care about school. As my grades started to fall my 3rd-grade teacher told me that I wasn’t going to succeed in math and I almost believed her because I believed black men couldn’t succeed in school. In middle school, I started off terribly. I tried to fit in however in return my grades fell as I was barely getting C’s. I fell asleep in classes and I often got sent out of class. Also, I didn’t have a relationship with my teachers and constantly argued with them during class. In 9th grade, things changed because I realized that if I continued down this path that it was leading nowhere. I pushed myself towards success by spending more time on homework and studying. Instead of  C’s I was getting  A’s and a few B’s. This success was addictive and encouraged me to pursue it more. My sophomore year I decided to take advanced classes. I realized the advanced pace was better for me because the other students who weren't serious about school weren’t in my classes and didn’t distract me. I grew connections with my teachers and gained a good reputation amongst teachers.

I recall the awe I felt last week when I harvested a giant sunflower, discovering at least ten potatoes growing in its roots, or when I found a sweet potato the size of a football. I had planted the seed potato pieces last year. I think about jalapenos, how scratches on their skin indicate spiciness level. The satisfaction I felt the first time I ate a piece of food I grew at the farm, a raw green-bean. The pleasure I feel knowing friends and teachers also eat the food I grow; we donate the farm's produce to our school's dining hall and sell it at the weekly farmer's market in the parking lot.","After farm, I will work a shift at the Farmer's Market. I will sit, perhaps eating Thai iced-tea-flavored ice cream from another stand, ready to explain where the farm is located, who works it, what we do with unsold food, and, finally, whether the price for a head of lettuce is negotiable (it is). Sometimes, I remember farmers I met during an exchange trip to Yangshuo, China, who were selling pomelos and bamboo shoots. I think about how to me, the difference between one-versus-two dollars for pomelos seems miniscule, but for those farmers, it means a lot. They rely solely on farming to feed their families; I farm for the pleasure of learning what they do out of necessity.","As I carry my share of tomatoes to the shed - tomatoes I nurtured from seeds into sprouts into fruits – I contemplate how much farm has done for me. I can't sit down to a meal without imagining the plants on my plate as seeds and then sprouts, without wondering about the many hands that brought them to my table. Education, to me, means understanding the hidden processes that make up daily life. Playing with the farm chickens - Pablo, Claude, Vincent, Leonardo - and knowing how the coating around an egg works as a natural preservative makes me appreciate my omelet a tad more. Watching weeds that I pulled from various beds slowly decompose into fertilizer in the compost pile makes me consider the roles carbon and nitrogen cycles play in that process.","Although I initially joined farm because I wanted to try something new, I quickly found that the work offers a balance with the intellectual work of the rest of my day. The farm connects education with experience; teaching me to see the application of my classroom learning in a real setting. Being able to see the relevance of what I am studying piques my curiosity. I aspire to maintain this connection between education and experience throughout my life, and will always find ways to contribute to my community, locally or globally. I will look for soil to cultivate, using my learning to see and understand more of the world, whether it be the natural environment or the way people live."],"tag":"popular","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=466"},{"id":"1EsZtHRhpDQRNFq3rMk0tTGWLK2UBC5cNAyr5z9ZhONE","featured":"","prompt":"","college":"University of Chicago","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"Illinois","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2018,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T06:17:58.441Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Dear Christian, the admissions staff at the University of Chicago would like to inform you that your application has been “put on the line.” We have one spot left and can’t decide if we should admit you or another equally qualified applicant. To resolve the matter, please choose one of the following:","Rock, paper, or scissors.","You will be notified of our decision shortly.","Response:","Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  Wait... paper beats rock? Since when has a sheet of loose leaf paper ever defeated a solid block of granite? Do we assume that the paper wraps around the rock, smothering the rock into submission? When exposed to paper, is rock somehow immobilized, unable to fulfill its primary function of smashing scissors?  What constitutes defeat between two inanimate objects?","Maybe it’s all a metaphor for larger ideals. Perhaps paper is rooted in the symbolism of diplomacy while rock suggests coercion. But does compromise necessarily trump brute force? And where do scissors lie in this chain of symbolism?","I guess the reasoning behind this game has a lot to do with context. If we are to rationalize the logic behind this game, we have to assume some kind of narrative, an instance in which paper might beat rock. Unfortunately, I can’t argue for a convincing one.","As with rock-paper-scissors, we often cut our narratives short to make the games we play easier, ignoring the intricate assumptions that keep the game running smoothly. Like rock-paper-scissors, we tend to accept something not because it’s true, but because it’s the convenient route to getting things accomplished. We accept incomplete narratives when they serve us well, overlooking their logical gaps. Other times, we exaggerate even the smallest defects and uncertainties in narratives we don’t want to deal with. In a world where we know very little about the nature of “Truth,” it’s very easy—and tempting—to construct stories around truth claims that unfairly legitimize or delegitimize the games we play.","Or maybe I’m just making a big deal out of nothing…","Fine. I’ll stop with the semantics and play your game.","But who actually wants to play a game of rock-paper-scissors?  After all, isn’t it just a game of random luck, requiring zero skill and talent? That’s no way to admit someone!","Wrong.","Studies have shown that there are winning strategies to rock-paper-scissors by making critical assumptions about those we play against before the round has even started. Douglas Walker, host of the Rock-Paper-Scissors World Championships (didn’t know that existed either), conducted research indicating that males will use rock as their opening move 50% of the time, a gesture Walker believes is due to rock’s symbolic association with strength and force. In this sense, the seemingly innocuous game of rock-paper-scissors has revealed something quite discomforting about gender-related dispositions in our society. Why did so many males think that brute strength was the best option? If social standards have subliminally influenced the way males and females play rock-paper-scissors, than what is to prevent such biases from skewing more important decisions? Should your decision to go to war or to feed the hungry depend on your gender, race, creed, etc?","Perhaps the narratives I spoke of earlier, the stories I mistakenly labeled as “semantics,” carry real weight in our everyday decisions. In the case of Walker’s study, men unconsciously created an irrational narrative around an abstract rock. We all tell slightly different narratives when we independently consider notions ranging from rocks to war to existence. It is ultimately the unconscious gaps in these narratives that are responsible for many of the man-made problems this world faces. In order for the “life of the mind” to be a worthwhile endeavor, we must challenge the unconscious narratives we attach to the larger games we play—the truths we tell (or don’t tell), the lessons we learn (or haven’t really learned), the people we meet (or haven’t truly met).","But even after all of this, we still don’t completely understand the narrative behind rock-paper-scissors.  ","I guess it all comes down to who actually made this silly game in the first place... I’d like to think it was some snotty 3rd grader, but then again, that’s just another incomplete narrative."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=945"},{"id":"1EyxPsZyaa4OlvmATPKcYooFNZXGFME5l0cRWsfUtHs0","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"rejected","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"2018-10-04T19:56:04.270Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.","Throughout my years in both middle school and high school, I have taken up many leadership positions. From several positions in Associated Student Body to captain of my volleyball team. However, I think the one positions that has had the biggest impact on others is my current position as Interclub Council Representative for my Middle College program. Not only do I play a key role in keeping the program updated about the happenings around the college I also serve a key role in planning for the whole program. It is one of my jobs to help build a schedule for the programs 200+ students. This includes prom planning, fundraising, events the college is putting on that we are participating in, yearbook, senior banquet, and more. By being in this position I have the expectation to make sure that this year will be an unforgettable one for the seniors and a pathway for the juniors. Now when it comes to the actual meetings I go to for the college that is a slightly different matter. It is actually like being your high school’s student representative for school board meetings but instead you are meeting the college’s board. During these meetings I report what is happening with my program and then find out what is happening throughout the college. This helps since then all of the students will know what to look forward to and us officers will be able to adequately plan for it. Taking part in this also lets me know how to make sure my program gets involved in these events.","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.","An educational boundary I overcame was dealing with a D grade for Spanish 1 in my sophomore year. Since I took the class as a night school option it was not just students taking Spanish 1 it was for Spanish 1, 2, and 3; this lead to me having a hard time keeping up and leaving me ultimately confused. However, regardless of the reason I do not deal with failure very nicely and this grade stressed me out to the max. I quickly had to rearrange my previous educational plans in order to make up for this terrible grade. I had decided to take both semesters of Spanish for summer school in order to take Spanish 2 when I started my junior year. This changed however when I was accepted into my district’s Middle College program at Moreno Valley Community College. I was not able to make it up over that summer but I did take it in that fall semester. Even though it was a college class it was easy to follow and allowed me to actually learn about the language itself. Continuing with the fact that it was a college class, in order to make up for the fact that is was still in high school I worked even harder than usual. Constantly studied both the upcoming material and what we were learning at that time. I also made it my habit to listen to Spanish music while working so that I was surrounded by the language. Thanks to all that I was able to secure myself an A in one of my first college classes.","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?","The most significant challenge I have faced was dealing with my inferiority complex when it came to my older brother and younger sister. Growing up I would always hear how naturally smart they were when it came to things like GATE (Gifted and Talented Education) testing and grades. I, being the only one who did not test into GATE, felt that I was not as good as them when it came to school. However, since I did not like this way of thought I worked for admittance into the program and was allowed to join the GATE program as long as I kept my grades up. So growing up I would work twice as much as they would so that I would never be seen as below them. This included making sure I would get the same teachers that my older brother had so that I knew I would have the same amount of coursework. By doing this I created opportunities to excel myself and not allow for slacking off. This moved me from just barely being allowed into GATE to a hard worker who deserved to be there. I now aim for the best for everything I do in school. This includes sports, grades, clubs, leadership positions, and many more. If I believe it will be good for my future I want to take part in. Now this has helped me out, but there were some downsides to this way of thinking. I did not like my younger sister very much growing up because I would always feel that she was better than me because of her natural born advantage, being that she was considered smarter than me. So in order to become a better person for both of our sakes I switched up my way of thinking and worked hard on becoming a better person altogether. Thus, overcoming this complex of mine has reduced my worry of what would become of my relationship with my siblings. ","Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.","When it comes to my favorite subject in school I find it hard to settle on just one. I absolutely love anything and everything that has to do with the science. Chemistry, biology, psychology, earth science, etc. all of it is connected and opens a door to something new. Every time I learn something new from one subject I quickly try to see how it relates to another. However, if I had to choose one it would be chemistry. Which relates to my intended field of study of chemical engineering. Because I loved learning so much concerning science I knew I wanted to do something that kept me close to it. I finally decided I wanted to study chemical engineering during my sophomore year when I took chemistry for the first time. Day after day it continued to call on my attention and I explored further into the world of chemistry. As I did learn more I realized how much I loved it and wanted to continue to surround myself with it. Therefore, I made the decision to dedicate my major to chemistry. However, I was not sure what field of chemistry at first it took me some time to decide. I finally did decide when I realized that I would be able to mix together chemistry and one of my most outstanding qualities: improving things that already exist. That being said the impact chemistry has had on me and will continue to have on me will be one that will last a lifetime."],"tag":"popular","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=0"},{"id":"1FuNxQu00_tpfU67vEkzosrjrjDsMGENd-bXbsgC4TNs","featured":"","prompt":"Common App","college":"","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2018,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T05:32:13.079Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Every Saturday morning, I’d awaken to the smell of crushed garlic and piquant pepper. I would stumble into the kitchen to find my grandma squatting over a large silver bowl, mixing fat lips of fresh cabbages with garlic, salt, and red pepper. That was how the delectable Korean dish, kimchi, was born every weekend at my home.","My grandma’s specialty always dominated the dinner table as kimchi filled every plate. And like my grandma who had always been living with us, it seemed as though the luscious smell of garlic would never leave our home. But even the prided recipe was defenseless against the ravages of Alzheimer’s that inflicted my grandma’s mind.","Dementia slowly fed on her memories until she became as blank as a brand-new notebook. The ritualistic rigor of Saturday mornings came to a pause, and during dinner, the artificial taste of vacuum-packaged factory kimchi only emphasized the absence of the family tradition. I would look at her and ask, “Grandma, what’s my name?” But she would stare back at me with a clueless expression. Within a year of diagnosis, she lived with us like a total stranger.","One day, my mom brought home fresh cabbages and red pepper sauce. She brought out the old silver bowl and poured out the cabbages, smothering them with garlic and salt and pepper. The familiar tangy smell tingled my nose. Gingerly, my grandma stood up from the couch in the living room, and as if lured by the smell, sat by the silver bowl and dug her hands into the spiced cabbages. As her bony hands shredded the green lips, a look of determination grew on her face. Though her withered hands no longer displayed the swiftness and precision they once did, her face showed the aged rigor of a professional. For the first time in years, the smell of garlic filled the air and the rattling of the silver bowl resonated throughout the house.","That night, we ate kimchi. It wasn’t perfect; the cabbages were clumsily cut and the garlic was a little too strong. But kimchi had never tasted better. I still remember my grandma putting a piece in my mouth and saying, “Here, Dong Jin. Try it, my boy.”","Seeing grandma again this summer, that moment of clarity seemed ephemeral. Her disheveled hair and expressionless face told of the aggressive development of her illness.","But holding her hands, looking into her eyes, I could still smell that garlic. The moments of Saturday mornings remain ingrained in my mind. Grandma was an artist who painted the cabbages with strokes of red pepper. Like the sweet taste of kimchi, I hope to capture those memories in my keystrokes as I type away these words.","A piece of writing is more than just a piece of writing. It evokes. It inspires.

How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? ","Captivating an audience has always been my strong suit,  I definitely am able to herd in people’s attention and also provide them the ears needed to later broadcast their words. Public speaking is something I’ve been comfortable with since I was twelve, I'm confident but not so brazen that I'm unapproachable. It’s a strong factor for me as a leader because I feel like it's my best connection to my peers; it establishes a mutual respect. Public speaking has been a skill I've exercised in many situations, from being elected for secretary of Spanish Honor Society to speaking in familiar circles such as my youth group. I’ve held positions as simple as a representative and as difficult as president, but no matter the title I find that eloquence comes in use each time."," This year I studied rhetoric in AP English Language. The class has significantly helped me with making sure that whenever I speak, I do so collectively and firmly. Strengthening my voice has tremendously enhanced my leadership skills, so much that I've felt confident enough to take the challenge of restarting a dying club. Speaking out makes me feel empowered and helps me to realize how significant I can be to the world. I know there is power in words and not just my own. That's why I am prepared to revive the Black Student Union on my campus this coming year; it is a club that I owe much to. It was a place of opportunity and nurturing for me and my desire is to give back ensure it lives for the students to come. I want to leave something behind for the future that expands students’ capacity. As a senior I'm going to foster a place where others can come to learn, speak, and spread the same empowerment I feel, because looking back on my high school career, public speaking was the forte that solidified the leader I am today. ","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.","An educational barrier I have faced is financial restriction. I come from a family of seven children, a dollar holds heavy value in my home. Both my father and mother lack the sufficient resources needed to support many activities. During high school all the pamphlets and college plans encouraged students to visit and experience the campuses they were considering.  All of the Californian universities I had interest in were at least two hours away; it wasn’t really in my parents’ capabilities to simply pick up and take me to visit them. But despite this, I wouldn't let myself be hindered. I sought out an alternative, any way for me to get what I needed.","    I soon learned about Project BEST (Black Excellence in Scholarship and Teaching) in my school and joined. I later came to know that the group focused on touring California’s campuses and exposing student to the many options for college. My freshman and sophomore year I devoted myself and visited five universities, Stanford and four UC campuses included. Being in that environment was a splash of cold water in my face. I was shaken — and even more — awoken. These were some of the best some schools, harboring some of the very best minds, and they were within my reach. I realized It wasn't impossible. I'd found a way to get myself this far. I told myself if I really wanted it, money wasn't going to stop me; I'd get myself farther. ","It was an amazing opportunity that I didn’t hesitate to take advantage of, and that exposure has made me aware of my options and what universities are best for me and my goals. Participating in the Experience Berkeley itself this summer was a incomparable privilege that I was able to use and I am completely grateful for the help it has given me. College is the next milestone of my life! I have been and will continue doing all I can to ensure that I give myself the best chance possible to pursue my passions.","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?","In my seventeen years the greatest challenge I have ever faced was adjusting to the drastic changes that struck my life when I was twelve. My entire life up to that year I hadn’t known there was much of a world past my small town because I became so accustomed to my surroundings. It was predominantly Mexican-immigrant and predominantly low income. That summer of 2010 my parents had divorced; their marriage had been under financial stress among other things. I had expected my life to change as far as my parents separating, but I hadn't expected to find myself in Bakersfield at a whole new school and experiencing my first case of culture shock. It seemed as though my whole life had been uprooted and I was forced to adjust to it. I loved my school and life in Wasco, but coming to Bakersfield threw me from a pond to a lake, and I wasn't the big fish anymore. For the first time in my life I wasn't able to give basic effort, I didn't have the reassurance that I’d still be number one. If I wanted to be distinguished here, I'd have to really work. It was this moment I learned that if you don't hustle and commit to do something, someone else will sweep past and do it for you. ","The academics were better here and the people another economic class. I realized that I wanted to succeed farther than my parents and I wanted to be just as smart and driven as the kids at my school. Being shown a grander life encouraged me to stay motivated, to stay progressing. That year I received national honor and recognition for my academic success in the United States Achievement Academy. I had thought to myself, “these kids are going to take off into the big world and I can't let them leave me behind.” ","The challenge of change affected my life from that day on. I am still driving forward with the same competitiveness, the same determination to set my goals and reach them because I promised to be just as much a part of the world as anyone.","Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?","I have a burning desire to change the condition of the world around me and I believe it's what sets me apart from any other person. I am passionate about increasing my knowledge of cultures and the developments of peoples and countries. Transitioning to my college I know now I'd like to use the UCs' courses to expand my knowledge as a global citizen and grant me the skills I need to make an active difference. It is ultimately my goal to be a woman who aids poverty-stricken countries through medicine. The passion I feel for this has given me a drive like no other. I've seen poverty and I know I want to make a difference.","My spring break of sophomore year I had the opportunity to visit my grandfather for the first time since he had been deported a year prior. I lived for a week in poor Mexico and I was astounded. Parents worked all day and children cared for their siblings; all they were doing was surviving day by day. In America kids have iPads, in Mexico they have worn shoes and their imaginations. I played outside, I remembered what it was to be left to my own devices — to be unprivileged. I purchased candy for less than a dollar, so much less that I was able to buy for all of the children who had been playing “en la calle”. The people are poor and growing poorer; I came to find my own grandfather couldn’t afford proper surgery. It was staggering to realize conditions in other countries were far worse than this. The people here at least had drinkable water, but there are countries lacking even that. ","Being Afro-Latina, I have and will face adversity, but nothing will stand in the way of my passion. I've been so blessed it's time I do unto others. I need to be the change and I know with the University of California I will garner the knowledge, experience, and confidence to do so.

Coaches weren’t present during the school day, which left me to find a way to tame a rambunctious group of fourteen year olds. In my first attempts of running the class, my team members began to resent me. Too much of our time was wasted by talking and refusing to dress out in a timely manner. The team members that were dedicated were thrown off by this group of freshmen who were loud and disrespectful.

I told the more mature team members that I was depending on them to be role models and not encourage disruptive behavior. I had to take phones away and move talkative members, but I also made time to talk to everyone and create moments for the team to bond. At the end of every major season I hosted a party at my house for the team in which we livestreamed finals and enjoyed each other's company.

I took every repetition they did, and I opened myself to the same criticism I subjected them to.

Words cannot describe the freedom and certainty I felt as I danced and spun my flag across the football field. Nothing mattered to me but the moves I made in that moment. ","Through my high school career I have been asked to create rifle choreography for our first JV Color Guard team, a visual for the Bulldog Brigade’s showing of Cirque Du Soleil, and be an assistant choreographer to the Bulldog Theater Company’s production of The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee. The school musical was the longest and most daunting task, because I was responsible for dance work that would soon be performed for a paying audience. In the beginning I found myself constantly looking to the head choreographer to validate my work. However, as I began to understand the show and the characters, I saw how movement would bring each piece of music to life. A week before opening night, the ballet number of the show had been untouched by the head choreographer, so I choreographed it myself. I taught  turns, jumps, and a lift to the two actors in the number. They rehearsed with me for hours to polish every move. I watched them take my work and embed it into a story, and it was awe inspiring to see my passion on stage. Most rewardingly, the audience reacted with the laughs and sighs of adoration I had hoped to provoke from them. Then I understood that dance is not only where I gained the confidence to express my ideas. It’s a form of communication that requires empathy, a skill I can use in every aspect of life and profession. ","What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? ","My forearms were black and blue, my entire body was sore, and I had never been more determined in my life. My sophomore year, I was finally given the chance to be on my color guard saber line. This was my first time spinning a weapon, and I felt that I had to prove my right to have this spot on the team. During my first week on this new piece of equipment, I was told I had to toss a five. Every practice I would work on tossing. I’d watch the saber spin one, two, three, four, five times in the air for it to only come back down to strike my wrist. I’d try again, tossing the saber up, watching it spin with my hands stretched out to hopefully catch it. It loudly crashed on the gym floor. I felt embarrassed. I wanted so badly to not disappoint my coaches. The point of me auditioning was to improve, to show that I can move up in this sport. Fortunately, there was one senior on my team that wanted me to succeed almost as much as I did. She tossed with me, critiqued me, and always gave me words of encouragement. I tried again to fulfill this one request from my coach. The saber spun in the air one, two, three, four, five times, and it landed perfectly in my hopeful, outstretched hands. From then on, I only improved. Once I understood how to manipulate the equipment in the most basic ways, I was able to be taught any choreography that included this piece of equipment. My arms returned to a healthy color and I showed my coaches what I was capable of. I performed basic tosses, tosses I turned under, and even just danced with my saber. I say spinning saber is my greatest skill not only because I can now do it almost flawlessly, but because I gained this skill through determination and dedication. It reminds me that I’ve improved from the person I was just months before picking up a saber for the first time. "," Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.","I will never dread going to the dentist again. However, dread was exactly what I felt the last time I had an eight am dentist appointment. The last thing I expected was for my check up to result in an educational opportunity. My mother had been bragging about my inclination towards medicine to my dentist, and as I blushed and went to excuse my mother from the doctor, he asked if I would like to shadow him. He had a crown placement coming up, and thought I could benefit from seeing how dentistry worked. I thanked him repeatedly in my flustered excitement, and then thanked my mother for speaking so fondly of me.","My first day in the cold dentist office was a four hour shift with Dr.Ismailyan. I had hope that by shadowing him I would further understand the true life and responsibility of a doctor. During my time there, I  was taught the difference between porcelain and silver fillings, saw how a crown was made and placed, and was introduced to the journey that is creating a well adjusted pair of dentures. I saw that no moment was wasted. If a patient wasn’t being seen, we were prepping for the next or writing reports on the last. I especially enjoyed meeting the other doctors in the office and discussing their different educational routes.","When seeing patients, Dr. Ismailyan would quiz me with questions about the tools he used. I was able to tell him that the gel he was using would prevent bleeding, or the blue paper he asked patients to grind between their teeth would prove a successful filling was done. Standing over his shoulder, taking notes as he consulted with and operated on patients led me to deciding two things. First, My future will be dedicated to helping others. Second, I want to study medicine, because under all the excitement, there was a sense of belonging."],"tag":"featured","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=755"},{"id":"1PKkb1BKUIfXcfJ51uQuqCAbk0bZM7R1qJXEFni1SQiw","featured":true,"prompt":"","college":"New York University","applicationStatus":"","state":"New York","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2015,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T06:27:39.342Z","image":"","paragraphs":["My small body and head of curly hair trotted over to the refrigerator in search of some butter for my bread. I shifted some cans of half-opened Goya beans and the remnant of a brick of dulce de leche that had seen better days. After much shuffling, I spotted the big brown container of margarine. Carefully placing the tub on the kitchen table and readying for my “feast,” I opened the container. To my dismay, it was filled with arroz con pollo. My eyes tightened and my stomach made Chewbacca noises. Maybe I could mash the dulce de leche on top of the bread.","My finding was not a surprise. Rather it was lesson number 73 engraved within the book of Dominican-bred frugality. Why buy 99 cent storage containers when the products we buy already provide them for free? These lessons came in Spanish with the speed of a bull in a bullring. It is a struggle for immigrant parents to successfully pass on values of frugality to their children while living in a developed country with a perceived flow of plenty. But my mother’s iron will was the perfect match for those incongruences.","For a child, things like magic, fairy tales, and free MacBook offers make it difficult to grasp the value of money and to quantify the struggles that some families face to make ends meet. The collective hope is that through hard work and a miracle, one ends up figuring out how to make five dollars out of five cents.","This fervor to be frugal and purposeful is something that was passed down to me much like some families pass down an obsession with monogramming or Thanksgiving Day traditions. My trailblazing family’s thrifty efforts were legendary in our neighborhood. We started reusing and repurposing way before it was trendy. We made do with what we had and made what we had do more in order to awkwardly swim toward the Dominican American dream.","Frugality is a game, or at least we made it into one. A game of who can save the most money by turning off lights, keeping the heater off and going to the library when the apartment got too hot. A game of who could make a skirt out of a short dress or find a scholarship for swimming lessons at the Y.M.C.A. The act of conserving money, the audacity to solve problems no one has thought of before is what set my family apart. Together we share our victories in a little tribe of four Amazon warriors partaking in our own version of the show, Survivor: NYC edition.","The phrase “making do” could evoke connotations of stagnation and despair for some; but for me it is about understanding my situation and being proactive. The values I gained from being able to make do are unparalleled. Making do gifted me with resiliency and gratitude. Making do allowed me to internalize acceptance and to value effort.","Lesson 978 took place last winter. I woke up at home with numb toes. The temperature inside the house was evidently no different from outside. I questioned my seemingly crazy mother to which she replied, “Come cuddle with me.” With closer inspection, I found my two sisters under the covers. The average family can spend up to $1,000 on heating their apartment, but my home is already comforting in its own way. A small bed with too many people in it, arms and legs perfectly intertwined. It doesn’t get better than that on a cold morning.","The laughs we exchange keep me warm, my grandmother’s advice, sigue adelante, or keeping moving forward, resonates with me, the arroz con pollo in the butter container satisfies me and our love for each other fuels me with drive to excel.

Why is it that the people who influence us most influence us in ways that are not easily quantified? Through her work with abused children, my mother has shown me the heroism of selfless dedication to a worthy cause. By being an upstanding individual, my playwriting teacher in middle school acted as an inspiring male role model at a time when I needed one most. By being approachable and interesting, my World History teacher in my freshman year of high school opened my eyes to the connections between a society's culture and its history and broadened my view of cultures and the world. While these influences mean much to me and have contributed greatly to my development, they came too easily to mind.","The fact that I could sit down and write a list of how these people influenced me suggests that the influence did not alter me in any profound way. These people are all my elders, and perhaps I feel distanced from them. The person whose influence shook me to the deepest level is a person whose influence is nearly impossible to describe. Mike, the best friend I’ve ever had, changed me, and I changed him at one of the most crucial times in our lives: the seventh grade. We developed our personalities, our senses of humor, and our love for girls at the same time and in the same manner. It would cheapen his influence to quantify it; I am what I am because of him; I cannot say that about anybody else.","Mike came to my school in the seventh grade, and we immediately clicked. Before he came, I didn’t feel like an outcast by any means, as I had my friends that I had known since first grade. However, until Mike, I never had anyone my age to identify with completely. Mike made me feel confident in who I was; he reaffirmed my drives and my thoughts and my inspirations. At this awkward stage in our lives, we found uncritical appreciation in each other. We both were obsessed by movies and had a similar sense of humor. We had the same problems and the same thoughts. That was all it took.","Halfway through that same year, Mike and I became inseparable. In fact, our yearbook had a section that lists the names of students and what they were never seen without. Under Mike, it read: “Ted, ” and under Ted: “Mike.” I became a staple at his house and he at mine. We no longer had to ask our parents if it was ok to have a sleepover on weekends, they assumed we would. On weekdays, we usually walked over to his house, which was near school, and hung out there till I had to go home. Our favorite past time on those long afternoons after school was to walk to the nearby food mart and get a bag of chips and two 24 oz. Coca-Colas. Watching a movie, we would sit on his couch with our chips and Coke and talk about our dreams of working together in the movies. Mike wanted to be a director and actor, and I wanted to be an actor and a playwright/screenwriter. It was the perfect combination. We even tried writing a few scripts together.","Of course, as two seventh grade boys, it wasn’t all skips through the park either. We were extremely competitive and would get into brutal fights for seemingly no reason at all. One time, I pulled out a chunk of his hair, but I don’t remember what started the fight. I think that our connection was so intense that we could not have normal emotions toward each other. As friends, we were best friends, but in an argument, we wanted to fight each other to the death. Still, the Wrestlemania days were rare; ordinarily, the intensity of that connection was a good thing. I was pretty shy about girls, and when I did talk about them with guys, I would usually just say a girl was \"hot.\" With Mike, I could really talk about girls and who they were; with Mike, I didn’t have to put on my public “cool” façade but could really say what I felt about a girl.","Then we went to separate high schools. We tried to maintain the friendship, and you might think we would have been able to since we had been so close, but we drifted apart. Our friendship was based on being near each constantly, of growing up in the same town, under the same conditions, with the same hopes, fears, and dreams. Now we still go to movies occasionally and hang out, but it's not the same, and we both know it. I thought Mike and I would be friends forever, and maybe we will be. I mean, we have to make those movies together, right? But the way things look right now, I doubt we will ever reconnect. Our friendship in the seventh grade was magical, and lightning doesn’t strike twice.","My playwriting teacher from middle school left, but I handled it. I learned a great deal from him, and I appreciate him for the subject he taught and the way that he taught it. I will probably miss my parents when I leave for college, but I doubt the separation will pain me deeply since the connection between parents and children will always be there. With Mike, I lost the best friend I ever had, and I lost that forever. Losing that kind of bond cuts deep, and I know it's the type of wound that doesn't heal. It’s the type of wound you just live with.","But just because we're not friends anymore, it doesn't slight the times we had when we were friends. Those times are what influenced me so deeply. No, Mike did not work some lesson into my heart, he worked himself into my heart, and even if I never see the guy again he changed me forever. I think that finding someone who you truly connect with and feel that you were destined to meet, someone who you feel truly understands you and makes you feel special, I think meeting someone like that is one of the most profound experiences you can have."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=944"},{"id":"1QWk0haHAWvcxRUnkH74tCLkhtDFSXA4px6O1j7iKBfA","featured":"","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"Maryland","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T04:44:20.166Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Superheroes","Legends, lore, and comic books all feature mystical, beautiful beings and superheroes—outspoken powerful Greek goddesses, outspoken Chinese maidens, and outspoken blade-wielding women. As a child, I soared the skies with my angel wings, battled demons with katanas, and helped stop everyday crime (and of course had a hot boyfriend). In short, I wanted to save the world.","But growing up, my definition of superhero shifted. My peers praised people who loudly fought inequality, who rallied and shouted against hatred. As a journalist on a social-justice themed magazine, I spent more time at protests, interviewing and understanding but not quite feeling inspired by their work.","At first, I despaired. Then I realized: I’m not a superhero.","I’m just a 17-year-old girl with a Nikon and a notepad—and I like it that way.","And yet—I want to save the world.","This understanding didn’t arrive as a bright, thundering revelation; it settled in softly on a warm spring night before my 17th birthday, around the fourth hour of crafting my journalism portfolio. I was choosing the best photos I’d taken around town during the 2016 presidential election when I unearthed two shots.","The first was from a peace march—my classmates, rainbows painted on their cheeks and bodies wrapped in American flags. One raised a bullhorn to her mouth, her lips forming a loud O. Months later, I could still hear her voice.","The second was different. The cloudy morning following election night seemed to shroud the school in gloom. In the mist, however—a golden face, with dark hair and two moon-shaped eyes, faces the camera. Her freckles, sprinkled like distant stars across the expanse of her round cheeks, only accentuated her childlike features and added to the soft feel of the photo. Her eyes bore into something beyond the lens, beyond the photographer, beyond the viewer—everything is rigid, from the jut of her jaw, to her stitched brows, her upright spine and arms locked across her chest, to her shut mouth. I picked the second picture within a heartbeat.","During my career as a photojournalist, I lived for the action shots: the excited gestures of a school board member discussing plans, a rabbi preaching vividly, a group of teenagers chanting and waving flags downtown. To me, the most energetic photos always told the biggest and best stories. They made me feel important for being there, for capturing the superheroes in the moment to share with everyone else. The softer moments paled in comparison, and I thought of them as irrelevant.It took about one second to tear down one year’s worth of belief.","The idea dawned on me when I was trapped within the distraught weight in the girl’s eyes. Sometimes the moments that speak the loudest aren’t the noisiest or the most energetic. Sometimes they’re quiet, soft, and peaceful.","Now, I still don’t completely understand who I am and who I want to be, but really, who does? I’m not a superhero—but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to save the world. There are just so many ways to do it.","You don’t always have to be loud to inflict change. Sometimes, it begins quietly: a snap of the shutter; a scrape of ink on paper. A breathtaking photograph; an astonishing lede. I’ve noticed the impact creativity can have and how powerful it is to harness it.","So, with that, I make people think and understand those surrounding them. I play devil’s advocate in discussions about ethics and politics. I persuade those around me to think past what they know into the scary territory of what they don’t—so to make people feel. I’m determined to inspire people to think more about how they can be their own superheroes and more.","See, that’s the kind of world-saving I do."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=765"},{"id":"1V12Bk-3-jHFLMLy2rTkM71UwQfGu8yM2Y911lK1dBH4","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"waitlisted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"2018-10-04T19:55:06.874Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.  ","I’ve utilized my creative and artistic individuality to impact my community and worldwide. Firstly, I created an online blog Blogging Everything Beautiful. I promote reading and literature and its significance to all age groups. For two years now, my blog has become a platform to express two of my passions, reading and art. On my website I graphically designed images. This expanded my knowledge when it came to working with design technology that I had little experience with. As someone who has enthusiasm for reading, I enjoy expressing my thoughts when it comes to reviewing and analyzing different works to a wider audience. Consequently, I’m able to gain different perspectives. ","Being able to create an important art piece out of nothing really allows me to draw inspiration and past experiences from myself. This action enables me to self-reflect and realize how creating makes me feel internally -- happy, calm, and free. I’ve recently started to invest into the diverse community and advocate for authors of color and representation of cultures. This has given me exposure to what I’m passionate about, equality, and how I can involve my talent to advocate. Painting and blogging has become a hobby that I plan to make use of in the future to help balance leisure and work time. I’m definitely eager to progress over time as I believe that I have the ability to develop my creativity.","In addition to my blog, I’m also an online marketplace seller on Etsy. I showcase my artistic abilities by offering my paintings and works up for sale. I’ve been trying different mediums over the course of years, however I’m most comfortable with acrylic paint because of its ability to create such opaque images.  As I’ve experimented with new techniques, I’ve come to love self-expressive art movements such as Post Impressionism and Abstract Expressionism. I utilized my creative side in order to put myself on the marketplace, but to also structure my self confidence. To be creative in multiple ways is a fortunate aspect that I take advantage of, especially artistically and using innovative thinking to solve personal problems.","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced. ","One opportunity that I have taken advantage of is the Education Talent Search Program powered by UC Davis. ETSP is a free program targeted towards students in need of guidance and support throughout their education. This support can range from providing a FAFSA mentor to students, from receiving workshops for the UC Application process.  During my sophomore year, I was invited to the program by my high school’s ETS adviser. I felt that I could utilize extra information to ensure a stable education and maintain an enthusiastic attitude throughout high school. I’ve been encouraged to focus on career paths and financial aid opportunities, such as EOP in college. For example, I’ve taken advantage of being informed about SAT and ACT deadlines, as well as scholarship information and guidance for the Cal State Apply.  I knew that I wanted to be aware of educational options that I could use to be prosperous for my future. With that being said,  I attended the meetings and kept in touch with my ETS adviser every month. I took advantage of being able to receive SAT and ACT waivers, attending Senior Day at a UC Campus, and to a Preview Day for incoming college freshmen. These exposures were valuable as this was an educational opportunity for me to ready myself. I’ve been able to visit several University campuses within California, speak to students that attend UCs and CSUs, and get connected with further resources that have expanded my range of possibilities. By investing myself into ETS, I’ve been able to recognize just how much there is to know about my future. This program has become important in supporting and guiding my academic work. Therefore, I took a significant advantage into my own hands and used resources available that will benefit me in the future. Overall it has become a major commitment worth my attention.","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement? ","The most significant challenge that I have faced is when I realized that I may be clinically depressed. This was a constant challenge that affected my educational performance, communication skills, and comfortability within my household and community. At the time, I frequently dismissed this mentality as I needed to focus on my schoolwork. However, my academic execution was negatively impacted as I was inattentive in class and neglected to sleep or eat. Throughout the past years I’ve still been overcoming this challenge, but it has become less difficult. I decided to use my resources and reach out to media sources, such as the Buddy Project, and my closest friends. The Buddy Project allows people to communicate with individuals who may have similar experiences to you. In the past, I was hesitant when it came to asking for help because I was content with being independent. I knew that I needed to take the situation into my own hands because it was ultimately affecting my academic achievements. I resorted to the first step of revitalization which is self-reflection. I focused on what wasn’t enjoyable about my unsettled development and I brainstormed ideas to dismiss these aspects from my life. This was the most difficult part of overcoming this challenge and I still haven’t entirely completed this step. However I found what I love and used that as a goal or reassurance that I can progress. I discovered that I’m more than this obstacle and now I can apply this experience to become a better me. I’ve acknowledged the negative environment that I was creating and realized that I didn’t want to be filled with sorrow and misplacement anymore. So I found myself a home. This sense of place was within my blog, my education, and literature. Often I was doubting my abilities because of my depression, but to overcome this I continued to understand my successes academically or personally. In fact, I’ve used this challenge to spark interest in future fields of study, such as psychology and sociology. I hope to apply this knowledge to a career as well.","What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?  ","At school I am currently the Vice President of Around the World club. Our main objective is to influence the school to acknowledge the world around us and how we can make a difference. We’ve organized an annual Breast Cancer Awareness Fundraiser and also collaborated with local companies to raise money for those affected by the Napa Valley Atlas Fires. In the past, we have visited local community centers to read to the youth and educate them. As a whole, we’ve become advocates of spreading awareness of the conditions of our community. This advocacy could range from environmental issues to social standards.  In order to get these events running within the club, I have taken the initiative of emailing companies professionally and handling paperwork throughout each meeting. Skills that I use within this club include using an authoritative voice when needed and applying my creative perspective towards producing effective fundraisers for my community.","Another form of community service that I have committed to is within the North Bay Mustangs Youth Sports Organization. Again, this is a community-based organization that has a main objective of keeping children away from bad influences, such as drugs, in order to keep them active and healthy. Using my morals and expressing good habits has become a vital part in making my community a better place, and it has been a privilege to be able to have a leadership role within it. I had the opportunity to involve myself with the youth and keep them active. This is done by attending their practices and games and being a figure of eagerness for the children. I also enthusiastically socialize and work with the team and family members in order to make their experience as worthwhile as mine. These opportunities and engagements have allowed me to become extroverted and to really apply my adventurous attitude in order to share my passions and create a better community  for future generations.

They had wanted to protect me--only six years old at the time--from the complex and morose concept of death. However, when the end inevitably arrived, I wasn’t trying to comprehend what dying was; I was trying to understand how I had been able to abandon my sick grandmother in favor of playing with friends and watching TV. Hurt that my parents had deceived me and resentful of my own oblivion, I committed myself to preventing such blindness from resurfacing.","I became desperately devoted to my education because I saw knowledge as the key to freeing myself from the chains of ignorance. While learning about cancer in school I promised myself that I would memorize every fact and absorb every detail in textbooks and online medical journals. And as I began to consider my future, I realized that what I learned in school would allow me to silence that which had silenced my grandmother. However, I was focused not with learning itself, but with good grades and high test scores. I started to believe that academic perfection would be the only way to redeem myself in her eyes--to make up for what I had not done as a granddaughter.  ","However, a simple walk on a hiking trail behind my house made me open my own eyes to the truth. Over the years, everything--even honoring my grandmother--had become second to school and grades. As my shoes humbly tapped against the Earth, the towering trees blackened by the forest fire a few years ago, the faintly colorful pebbles embedded in the sidewalk, and the wispy white clouds hanging in the sky reminded me of my small though nonetheless significant part in a larger whole that is humankind and this Earth. Before I could resolve my guilt, I had to broaden my perspective of the world as well as my responsibilities to my fellow humans.   ","Volunteering at a cancer treatment center has helped me discover my path. When I see patients trapped in not only the hospital but also a moment in time by their diseases, I talk to them. For six hours a day, three times a week, Ivana is surrounded by IV stands, empty walls, and busy nurses that quietly yet constantly remind her of her breast cancer. Her face is pale and tired, yet kind--not unlike my grandmother’s. I need only to smile and say hello to see her brighten up as life returns to her face. Upon our first meeting, she opened up about her two sons, her hometown, and her knitting group--no mention of her disease. Without even standing up, the three of us—Ivana, me, and my grandmother--had taken a walk together.","Cancer, as powerful and invincible as it may seem, is a mere fraction of a person’s life.

While I physically treat their cancer, I want to lend patients emotional support and mental strength to escape the interruption and continue living.

I tell her he is an artist like Georgia O’Keeffe. I do not know that I am lying. I do not know that he hasn’t sold a piece in months. I do not know that my mother sits at the kitchen table after I go to sleep and cries because the mortgage is past due and she can’t figure out a way to tell me that this year, Santa Claus just might not make it.","For Christmas, my father gives me a sparkling blue stone he found in the arroyo. I say thank you and pretend I mean it. Later, I stand on the edge of our brick patio and wind up my arm and throw the rock as far as it will go. It disappears inside the bristles of a pine tree.","I do not say goodbye to the arroyo before shutting the car door and stretching the seatbelt across my chest. I do not say goodbye because I think that I won’t miss it. We are leaving New Mexico. We are going to New York where my father will get a real job and we will become a real family. We drive alongside a cliff, the rock rough and jagged and sprinkled with a thousand tiny diamonds. I press my finger against the glass. This is why we’re here.","When I am 16 years old, my father takes me back to New Mexico and we go once more to the arroyo. The neglected trail is long gone now and we stumble in our tennis shoes over dried up cacti and colorless desert flowers. I am too old now to hold my father’s hand. He walks a few steps ahead of me and I do not see his face.","The arroyo is bone-dry, littered with dented soda cans, beaten strips of tire and mud-stained garbage bags.

I found myself drawn to the letters and playful application of the English alphabet, the intricate units of language.","For instance, phrases like “I love you,” whose incredible emotion is quantized to a mere set of eight letters, never cease to amaze me. Whether it’s the definitive pang of a simple “I am” or an existential crisis posed by “Am I”, I recognized at a young age how letters and their order impact language.","Spelling bees were always my forte. I’ve always been able to visualize words and then verbally string individual consonants and vowels together. I may not have known the meaning of every word I spelled, I knew that soliloquy always pushed my buttons: that -quy ending was so bizarre yet memorable! And intaglio with its silent “g” just rolled off the tongue like cultured butter.","Eventually, letters assembled into greater and more complex words.","I was an avid reader early on, devouring book after book. From the Magic Treehouse series to the too real 1984, the distressing The Bell Jar, and Tagore’s quaint short stories, I accumulated an ocean of new words, some real (epitome, effervescence, apricity), and others fully fictitious (doubleplusgood), and collected all my favorites in a little journal, my Panoply of Words.","Add the fact that I was raised in a Bengali household and studied Spanish in high school for four years, and I was able to add other exotic words. Sinfin, zanahoria, katukutu, and churanto soon took their rightful places alongside my English favorites.","And yet, during this time of vocabulary enrichment, I never thought that Honors English and Biology had much in common. Imagine my surprise one night as a freshman as I was nonchalantly flipping through a science textbook. I came upon fascinating new terms: adiabatic, axiom, cotyledon, phalanges…and I couldn’t help but wonder why these non-literary, seemingly random words were drawing me in. These words had sharp syllables, were challenging to enunciate, and didn’t possess any particularly abstract meaning.","I was flummoxed, but curious…I kept reading.","“Air in engine quickly compressing…”","“Incontestable mathematical truth…”","“Fledgling leaf in an angiosperm…”","“Ossified bones of fingers and toes…","…and then it hit me.

At day’s end, it’s language that is perhaps the most important tool in scientific education, enabling us all to communicate new findings in a comprehensible manner, whether it be focused on minute atoms or vast galaxies.","It’s equal parts humbling and enthralling to think that I, Romila, might still have something to add to that scientific glossary, a little permutation of my own that may transcend some aspect of human understanding.

It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.","At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place.","It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.","It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.","In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.","Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.","Interestingly, after studying foreign languages, I was further intrigued by my native tongue. Through my love of books and fascination with developing a sesquipedalian lexicon (learning big words), I began to expand my English vocabulary. Studying the definitions prompted me to inquire about their origins, and suddenly I wanted to know all about etymology, the history of words. My freshman year I took a world history class and my love for history grew exponentially. To me, history is like a great novel, and it is especially fascinating because it took place in my own world.","But the best dimension that language brought to my life is interpersonal connection. When I speak with people in their native language, I find I can connect with them on a more intimate level. I’ve connected with people in the most unlikely places, finding a Bulgarian painter to use my few Bulgarian words with in the streets of Paris, striking up a conversation in Spanish with an Indian woman who used to work at the Argentinian embassy in Mumbai, and surprising a library worker by asking her a question in her native Mandarin.","I want to study foreign language and linguistics in college because, in short, it is something that I know I will use and develop for the rest of my life. I will never stop traveling, so attaining fluency in foreign languages will only benefit me. In the future, I hope to use these skills as the foundation of my work, whether it is in international business, foreign diplomacy, or translation.","I think of my journey as best expressed through a Chinese proverb that my teacher taught me, “I am like a chicken eating at a mountain of rice.” Each grain is another word for me to learn as I strive to satisfy my unquenchable thirst for knowledge.","Today, I still have the travel bug, and now, it seems, I am addicted to language too."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=375"},{"id":"1bIylNDLfXcYBAyNlcORNQ1ZW2ci4eGqVCgVKW882RQw","featured":"","prompt":"","college":"Johns Hopkins University","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"Maryland","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2017,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T04:47:38.527Z","image":"","paragraphs":["And the Secret Ingredient is…","Step 1: Get the ingredients","On the granite countertop in front of me sat a pile of flour, two sticks of butter, and a bowl of shredded beef, just like the YouTube tutorial showed. My mind contorted itself as I tried figuring out what I was doing. Flanking me were two equally discombobulated partners from my Spanish class. Somehow, some way, the amalgamation of ingredients before us would have to be transformed into Peruvian empanadas.","Step 2: Prepare the ingredients","It looked easy enough. Just make a dough, cook the beef until it was tender, put two and two together, and fry them. What YouTube didn’t show was how to season the meat or how long you should cook it. We had to put this puzzle together by ourselves. Adding to the mystery, none of us knew what an empanada should even taste like.","Step 3: Roll out ten equally sized circles of dough","It would be dishonest to say everything went smoothly. I thought the dough should be thick. One team member thought it should be thin. The other thought our circles were squares. A fundamental truth about collaboration is that it’s never uncontentious. Everyone has their own expectations about how things should be done. Everyone wants a project to go their way. Collaboration requires observing the differences between the collaborators and finding a way to synthesize everyone’s contributions into a solution that is mutually agreeable.","Step 4: Cook the beef until tender","Collaborative endeavors are the proving grounds for Murphy’s Law: everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. The shredded beef, which was supposed to be tender, was still hard as a rock after an hour on the stove. With our unseasoned cooking minds, all ideas were valid. Put more salt in? Sure. Cook it at a higher temperature? Go for it. Collaboration requires people to be receptive. It demands an open mind. All ideas deserve consideration.","Step 5: Fry the empanadas until crispy","What does crispy even mean? How crispy is crispy enough; how crispy is too crispy? The back and forth with my teammates over everything from how thick the dough should be to the definition of crispy taught me a key ingredient of teamwork: patience.

I write screenplays, short stories, and opinionated blogs and am a regular contributor to my school literary magazine, The Gluestick. I have accumulated over 300 community service hours that includes work at homeless shelters, libraries, and special education youth camps. I have been evaluated by the College Board and have placed within the top percentile.","But I am not any of these things. I am not a test score, nor a debater, nor a writer. I am an anti-nihilist punk rockphilosopher. And I became so when I realized three things:","1) That the world is ruled by underwear. There is a variety of underwear for a variety of people. You have your ironed briefs for your businessmen, your soft cottons for the average, and hemp-based underwear for your environmental romantics. But underwear do not only tell us about who we are, they also influence our daily interactions in ways most of us don't even understand. For example, I have a specific pair of underwear that is holey, worn out but surprisingly comfortable. And despite how trivial underwear might be, when I am wearing my favorite pair, I feel as if I am on top of the world. In any case, these articles of clothing affect our being and are the unsung heroes of comfort.","2) When I realized I cannot understand the world. I recently debated at the Orange County Speech League Tournament, within the Parliamentary Division. This specific branch of debate is an hour long, and consists of two parties debating either side of a current political issue. In one particular debate, I was assigned the topic: “Should Nation States eliminate nuclear arms?” It so happened that I was on the negative side and it was my job to convince the judges that countries should continue manufacturing nuclear weapons. During the debate, something strange happened: I realized that we are a special breed of species, that so much effort and resources are invested to ensure mutual destruction. And I felt that this debate in a small college classroom had elucidated something much more profound about the scale of human existence. In any case, I won 1st place at the tournament, but as the crowd cheered when my name was called to stand before an audience of hundreds of other debaters, and I flashed a victorious smile at the cameras, I couldn’t help but imagine that somewhere at that moment a nuclear bomb was being manufactured, adding to an ever-growing stockpile of doom. And that's when I realized that the world was something I will never understand.","3) When I realized I was a punk rocker philosopher. One summer night, my friend took me to an underground hardcore punk rock show. It was inside a small abandoned church. After the show, I met and became a part of this small community. Many were lost and on a constant soul-search, and to my surprise, many, like myself, did not have a blue Mohawk or a nose piercing. Many were just ordinary people discussing Nietzsche, string theory, and governmental ideologies. Many were also artists creating promotional posters and inventive slogans for stickers. They were all people my age who could not afford to be part of a record label and did something extraordinary by playing in these abandoned churches, making their own CDs and making thousands of promotional buttons by hand. I realized then that punk rock is not about music nor is it a guy with a blue Mohawk screaming protests. Punk rock is an attitude, a mindset, and very much a culture. It is an antagonist to the conventional. It means making the best with what you have to contribute to a community. This was when I realized that I was a punk rock philosopher.","The world I come from consists of underwear, nuclear bombs, and punk rockers. And I love this world. My world is inherently complex, mysterious, and anti-nihilist. I am David Phan, somebody who spends his weekends debating in a three piece suit, other days immersed within the punk rock culture, and some days writing opinionated blogs about underwear.","But why college? I want a higher education. I want more than just the textbook fed classrooms in high school. A community which prizes revolutionary ideals, a sharing of multi-dynamical perspectives, an environment that ultimately acts as a medium for movement, similar to the punk rock community.

Being a Link Crew Leader, the freshmen who did Track found it easier to talk and hang out with me more than the other upperclassmen because I had met them before during Freshman orientation and Link Crew classroom visits. During one of our conversations Devyn, One of these freshman, told me that he believed that track was taking time away from him working on his football skills. He expressed to me that all of the other freshmen on the team were becoming better football players than he was and that they were passing him up. When he told me about this, I had an idea how to help him out using my knowledge that I gained from being both an athlete and in Link Crew, and I was able to give him some key advice. I let him know that Track was teaching him proper running form, increasing his speed, and improving his stamina; however, if he was not working on his football skills outside of Track also, the other freshmen would pass him up (regardless of his speed gains). He says the talk I gave him really helped him and I'm happy to say that he decided to stay in Track going on to compete on our JV 4x1 team.

At the show as I watched onlookers breakdown as we danced and saw Rocky’s girlfriend, who hadn’t smiled since his death, get excited and happy, I had a realization. Dance, like language, was meant to connect us. All our pains, cheers, thoughts, and differences are shared. I could feel the crowd connect on a level with me and my fellow dancers.

Having anticipated that I might not get to take AP Chemistry during the regular school year, I took the opportunity of piloting the new summer chemistry class the summer of my freshman year. Even though this was a great opportunity, the summer chemistry class hardly prepared me for what was to come. Although I was unable to fully grasp all of the rules and intricacies of Chemistry in the short time I was given in the summer class, I was able to learn how to use T-charts, the main elements used on the periodic table, how to read a periodic table, and most importantly how covalent and ionic bonds are formed. When I started AP Chemistry during the school year I did not understand concepts which I was supposed to have already covered in regular chemistry. Also, in a sense, I was a sophomore in junior/senior class, so there was really no other student in the class that I could bravely seek help from. I could tell the teacher was becoming frustrated with my lack of knowledge. I now see this adverse experience as a blessing. If I had not taken the summer chemistry class, I would never have been able to take AP Chemistry in high school and I would never have found out that I have the ability to teach myself. In the end I actually did end up passing both the AP Chemistry class and the AP test. ","        Looking back now The circumstances of the class helped me be both more outgoing self-driven., I was able to make friends with juniors and seniors that I still connect with today. I also had to teach myself and get my work done while also trying to learn from the teacher herself.","Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?","Back when I was a freshman and even before that, basketball was my main focus.  However the injury to my knee changed all that. An MRI showed that the Articular Cartilage protecting my femur had torn off from forced trauma and now not only was their an unprotected spot that was allowing my femur to be damaged, but I also had a big piece of cartilage floating around in my knee scraping everywhere. Watching my dreams crumble around me was not an instantaneous thing. It started off as a shock to me, then my naivety set in making me believe that everything would return to the way it was. Healing was never a simple process for me, dates kept being pushed back. Two months turned  into 8 months, and on top of that rehabilitation didn’t go as planned, it ended up being almost a year before I could even jog again. I became depressed having no idea with what I was to do with myself. The hardest points were when I would watch other people play basketball and think that life wasn’t worth living anymore. School became extremely difficult because I literally lost the energy to do anything. When that would happen I would lay on the floor for hours staring at the ceiling. I think the hardest part of the injury was not the injury itself, but my mother's attempts at encouragement. She told me sorry and that I should move on, but never that I could do it. Unable to find encouragement in others I had to really look deep into myself. Regardless of what the injury did to me, it did teach me to slow down. The life of a child athlete is a fast-paced one, however my knee injury changed my course. It was difficult however it allowed me to figure what I’m allowed to do and taught me that sometimes as humans we need to take time to “heal” whether it's emotionally, physically, mentally, or spiritually. It taught me that if you want encouragement, you have to close your eyes and summon it for yourself. It took me till the end of my sophomore year to realize this, and through this school has gotten easier and I have been able to learn so much more."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=482"},{"id":"1kjIoFctG0NkuF5Q8tnF7XDGdVLHj8OA-6UJOftr5Qj4","featured":"","prompt":"","college":"Manhattan College","applicationStatus":"","state":"New York","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2015,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T06:37:27.616Z","image":"","paragraphs":["The thought of achieving any sort of higher education has often been an overlooked, or just plain disregarded idea in my family for generations. I’ve come from a long line of ancestors that labored throughout life to make ends meet, often leaving school early to take up a job and support a struggling family. Only one of my grandparents even attended high school, let alone graduated. Both of my parents made it through, albeit barely passing, yet went straight to work, abandoning any idea of studying further due to poor finances, poor academics and a generally poor attitude to the sort of idea.","But I knew early on in life that they expected more of me, that I was supposed to serve as the outlier to the norm in my family and end the long line of subpar students, that I would be the one to further my education, and go on to do something more meaningful with my life.","The thought scared the hell out of me. And to be honest, it still does.","Because the thing is, I don’t know where I want to go from here. All my life I’ve never been able to give a response to that oft-asked question, “So Joe, what do you want to be when you’re grown up?” Had my grandparents been confronted with that same query, they couldn’t have answered simply because they had no choice in the matter. A Great Depression, a family of seven or a draft notice from the Army were among some of the more pressing issues at hand. They couldn’t answer because they had no other options. I can’t answer because I have too many.","Yet I want to answer that question. And I guess that’s part of the reason I’m writing this essay. I’ve accepted the fact that, right now, I simply don’t know who I’m going to be, and that it’s going to take some time before I can finally look around and think to myself, “I want to spend my life doing this.” But I’ve come to realize that college can serve as the catalyst that gets me there, the place where I can begin to learn and see the world on my own terms, and take advantage of the choices I’ve been blessed with the ability to make, when the same couldn’t be said about the generations that came before me. I know that with the freedom to study what I want to learn, I can pursue a career born, not out of necessity, but out of choice. I’ve been given the opportunity to change not just myself, but the attitude that my own family will have toward higher education, and the doors that it can open in their own lives.","Nevertheless, the thought of being the first in my family to attend college remains daunting. At times, I feel tasked with a responsibility of near-prophetic proportions, as if I’m The One to finally bring about an end to the decades-old struggle of “a lineage gone unlearned.” I’ve come to accept it as a challenge. And the more I think about it, the more I see it as something gratifying. It’s taken years of trial, but I will emerge as the outlier for my family.

Foaming at the mouth, I was ready to pass out. My body couldn’t stop shaking as I gasped for air, and the room started spinning.","Ten minutes prior, I had been eating dinner with my family at a Chinese restaurant, drinking chicken-feet soup. My mom had specifically asked the waitress if there were peanuts in it, because when I was two we found out that I am deathly allergic to them. When the waitress replied no, I went for it. Suddenly I started scratching my neck, feeling the hives that had started to form. I rushed to the restroom to throw up because my throat was itchy and I felt a weight on my chest. I was experiencing anaphylactic shock, which prevented me from taking anything but shallow breaths. I was fighting the one thing that is meant to protect me and keep me alive – my own body.","At five years old, I couldn’t comprehend what had happened. All I knew was that I felt sick, and I was waiting for my mom to give me something to make it better. I thought my parents were superheroes; surely they would be able to make well again. But I became scared when I heard the fear in their voices as they rushed me to the ER.","After that incident, I began to fear. I became scared of death, eating, and even my own body. As I grew older, I became paranoid about checking food labels and I avoided eating if I didn’t know what was in the food. I knew what could happen if I ate one wrong thing, and I wasn’t willing to risk it for a snack. Ultimately, that fear turned into resentment; I resented my body for making me an outsider.","In the years that followed, this experience and my regular visits to my allergy specialist inspired me to become an allergy specialist. Even though I was probably only ten at the time, I wanted to find a way to help kids like me. I wanted to find a solution so that nobody would have to feel the way I did; nobody deserves to feel that pain, fear, and resentment. As I learned more about the medical world, I became more fascinated with the body’s immune responses, specifically, how a body reacts to allergens. This past summer, I took a month-long course on human immunology at Stanford University. I learned about the different mechanisms and cells that our bodies use in order to fight off pathogens. My desire to major in biology in college has been stimulated by my fascination with the human body, its processes, and the desire to find a way to help people with allergies. I hope that one day I can find a way to stop allergic reactions or at least lessen the symptoms, so that children and adults don’t have to feel the same fear and bitterness that I felt."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=868"},{"id":"1r8ew9nXGwUbRhOPiG2tDE62y_5ZYRLLwBE6n1jKg_SI","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"waitlisted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"2018-10-04T19:56:04.182Z","image":"","paragraphs":["What have you done to make your school or community a better place?","I was selected out of twenty students to represent my school for a week at a summer camp called RYLA. I was very nervous attending the camp as I soon found out I was one of four African American people at the camp. Being as optimistic as possible, I absorbed as much from the camp as possible. I learned from the camp that positivity, confidence and perseverance are key tools to leading a successful life. Taking my three lessons back to my home in Sacramento, I went to volunteer at a basketball facility. I was put in the situation of working with an autistic young boy named Emmanuel. Emmanuel played basketball to release some of his energy and anger from home. Working with Emmanuel was important to m, being that I have my own special needs brother and I know it takes a little longer for people with special needs to learn. Emmanuel took longer to understand the new drills we did daily. For me it took a lot of patience to help Emmanuel because I’m familiar with playing fast paced basketball. Taking what I learned from the RYLA camp, I tried to instill confidence and positivity in him. I always encouraged him to keep trying at every drill as hard as he could and made sure to gave him positive feedback. When Emmanuel made a mistake, I ensured him it was okay to make mistakes and focused on the solution to fix future mistakes. Working with Emmanuel has motivated me to invest in my own sports facility when I get older. I want my facility to focus on special needs children and helping them get active, because many times special needs children never get the chance to participate in sports because of their lack of confidence. By working with Emmanuel, I was finally able to understand some of the problems and thinking processes my own brother has by seeing it from a different perspective. Working with Emmanuel was a life changing and humbling experience.","Describe an example of you leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time. "," ","In eleventh grade, my leadership class lost control. The new teacher running the class was poorly organized, and many of the students were seniors who joined for the looks of it and not interested in actually doing the required work. It was clear from the start we were going to have problems. During homecoming week, the events were not being successfully executed, so I took matters into my own hands. I explained to my leadership class that we had lost respect and we needed to prove our worth. I encouraged my leadership class to set their differences aside and think about school as a whole. The day of the rally, not enough decorations were made, so I broke the class into groups and each had their own jobs. During rally practice, I made sure everything was fully executed from the games, to performers, to transition times. In the end, the entire school gym was decorated from top to bottom. I hosted the rally, and the entire school had a great time. I received positive feedback from the administration. I also had to step up and actually address the problems while finding solutions to fix them. From that point forward, I greatly improved the efficiency of the class and quality of our events for the rest of the year. I learned that sometimes not all people have the same drive as I do, but it’s important to focus on my job, delegate specific jobs, and work hard.","Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it influenced you? ","         ","Change will only come if we as future leaders gain roles of positions that will lead to greater change. A future in business will allow me to create direct avenues of change and become one of the most successful business owners in the world. Throughout high school, I was exposed to classes in which  I learned about types of businesses, running businesses, and marketing products. Beyond the theory, the most important things I learn from taking business classes has come from interacting with my classmates as we run an actual business. Throughout these experiences, I learned that patience is essential because not everyone will work as efficiently as I do. Patience has played a strong role in helping me to ensure that our programs and initiatives run smoothly. Working with different students showed me that working with friends is not always smart and stereotyping others limits what their potential. Taking business has definitely motivated me more to work in the business field because it was exciting to work on an actual business where we design and sell t-shirts for our school community. I am the VP of Sales and Marketing, and I love it because I am a competitive person who is strong at communicating and advertising.  I narrowed the areas of business I want to work in to marketing, finance, and management. I have also become interested in working with international business because it is fun to explore new people and their cultures. Business is definitely a challenge, since I was not aware of the amount of work it took to maintain a businesses until I was running one of my own. I was awakened to the fact that many people run their businesses for money and not to help better society. Personally, I want to run multiple businesses that help the community. Giving back to the community through business is important because without the community, businesses would not be able to function. Additionally, I would like to help underprivileged and underrepresented communities because I know that business opportunities play a huge part in transforming low income communities.

My grandmother suddenly got very sick very quickly and my brother was struggling with his ongoing mental illness. Due to my grandmother’s illness, my mom had to shift most of her time to taking care of my grandmother and making sure she received the proper care. Unfortunately, my grandmother passed away a couple of weeks before my AP World History test. My brother’s schizophrenia, affecting his behavior in new ways everyday, was hard to balance. Between visiting my brother forty-five minutes away from home and making sure my grandmother was in good care an hour and a half from home, life seemed to completely turn upside down. At this point in my life, it looked as if it was over, but I realized that life still goes on. This was one of the most difficult adversities I had to experience which caused my effort and perseverance in class to diminish. There were days when I did not want to be at school. I did all my research on other high schools in Sacramento, as if leaving my school would solve all my problems. I learned the hard way that trying to leave the school would not solve any of my problems at all. Finally, my AP test and finals came, and I performed poorly on both. I was devastated. However, my sophomore year prepared me to successfully transition into my junior year, because I improved as a student both mentally and socially. I took the initiative to enroll for more AP classes and also made a commitment to score well in them. After my hard work, I finished my junior year with a 3.86 unweighted and a 4.46 weighted. I passed my AP U.S. History exam with a five, and by signing up for the many programs, I was able to participate in all of them.

It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.","At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place.","It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.","It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.","In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.","Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.","Interestingly, after studying foreign languages, I was further intrigued by my native tongue. Through my love of books and fascination with developing a sesquipedalian lexicon (learning big words), I began to expand my English vocabulary. Studying the definitions prompted me to inquire about their origins, and suddenly I wanted to know all about etymology, the history of words. My freshman year I took a world history class and my love for history grew exponentially. To me, history is like a great novel, and it is especially fascinating because it took place in my own world.","But the best dimension that language brought to my life is interpersonal connection. When I speak with people in their native language, I find I can connect with them on a more intimate level. I’ve connected with people in the most unlikely places, finding a Bulgarian painter to use my few Bulgarian words with in the streets of Paris, striking up a conversation in Spanish with an Indian woman who used to work at the Argentinian embassy in Mumbai, and surprising a library worker by asking her a question in her native Mandarin.","I want to study foreign language and linguistics in college because, in short, it is something that I know I will use and develop for the rest of my life. I will never stop traveling, so attaining fluency in foreign languages will only benefit me. In the future, I hope to use these skills as the foundation of my work, whether it is in international business, foreign diplomacy, or translation.","I think of my journey as best expressed through a Chinese proverb that my teacher taught me, “I am like a chicken eating at a mountain of rice.” Each grain is another word for me to learn as I strive to satisfy my unquenchable thirst for knowledge.","Today, I still have the travel bug, and now, it seems, I am addicted to language too."],"tag":"popular","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=726"},{"id":"1v0sLTTOxbsReV_TX5-MFg6VpoQTe2WWGTfiAZw7q2TE","featured":false,"prompt":"","college":"University of California - Berkeley","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"California","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2016,"dateUploaded":"2018-10-04T19:56:04.182Z","image":"","paragraphs":["Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.  ","A meaningful example of where I displayed a  leadership is when I positively influenced my peers during a college tour to Atlanta. To rally my fellow students to complete their UC applications, I encouraged  my friends to diligently work to improve their applications day and night. My peers and I would edit each other’s applications. As some students tend to be irresponsible, many of the students failed to submit their essays before the deadline. I took the initiative to contact the students who had not submitted their essays and requested that they send them in immediately. When it came to the day to find out who had got in, two of my friends and I ended up getting in. We ended up being three of the twenty-four students from across the country that got selected. This is one of the most impactful moments I have been able to create. Taking the initiative, ensuring that my peers were given a chance to be accepted into the program, proved to be a extremely rewarding experience.","When it comes to being a leader, I’m the type that will always try to give you that extra push for greatness.

As the years go by, I can see what a great leader I am becoming, ","I grew up homeless and had little to nothing, in and out of homeless shelters and forced to wear the same ragged outfits to school every week.  My Brother, Sister, and I were eating rice and beans every night and whatever else my mom can get with the little money she had. My mother and step- father struggled to make ends meet. When we had to leave the homeless shelters, we would have to go to run down hotels where it was so cold when I woke up in the morning the water i left out was frozen solid. ","Through all my trials and tribulations  I was still able to remain at the  top of my class, because I felt that  my education should come first. I didn't want my upbringing to be an excuse to why I couldn't succeed I did not allow my circumstances to limit my expectations and aspirations. I didn't want my future Family living like I did; not knowing where they would be living the next day. So when I got to the shelter or when I was on the bus I  would study and work on homework, and help my younger siblings so they could know how important and powerful knowledge is. I believe having a high level of education is greater than money, and can get you anywhere you want in life. This had an huge affect on my academic achievements, because if I was able to be top of my class then I can do it now. Today I am on track to being a Student Athlete Valedictorian. ","All in all, although we may not be able to control the obstacles we face in life, we must strive for excellence by holding firmly to our goals, beliefs, and aspirations. ","What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?  ","Something I have done to make my community a better place was going to the local Elementary school to mentor underprivileged and disadvantaged 2nd graders who resided in my community. The kids and I built  very strong bonds, because most of them grew up in the same situation as I did. Many of them were raised in broken families, violent homes and communities full of drugs and weaponry. Many of them struggled to find an avenue to escape the conditions to which we were subject for a way out, just as I did.","During their recess, I would pull kids aside and talk to them and see what problems they were going through.Many of them confided in me and knew that I would be there to consult them.  For most of the kids I was the only person they could talk, trust, and relate to. One of my mentees was named Ryon. Before I started mentoring him he would fight everyday in response to his experiences as a bully victim. ,By the end of the school year he was no longer fighting,  because I was able to mediate  a conversation between Ryon and the bullies. . Ryon stopped getting kicked out of class, and began volunteering in class more, as he became more eager to learn new class material.","I had the opportunity to witness Ryon transform into a responsible, diligent and hard working student that became one of the top students in his class.I will continue to mentor and serve as many students as possible in order to ensure that children of disadvantaged and underprivileged communities have access to resources that will allow one to succeed despite one's unbearable circumstances. There are so many other kids just like Ryon who desire to learn develop and succeed but lack the resources and support to do so. I will stand in the gap and continue to guide students into successful paths. ","Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?","Growing up in an all white school, I was the black  kid  who was treated like the “other” in the room. I got little help from teachers and told that I wouldn’t make it to college. I was told that  I was going to be held back and sent to another school.  Instead of letting this discourage me, I used that to push me         whenever I thought of quitting. The next school year I was passing all of my state tests and ended up on honor roll. I believe this separates me from others because when life begins to get hard I always think back to where I came from and how I have to keep excelling so my younger siblings know they can make it out of poverty. I believe if I don't lead by example for my siblings, they won't excel and believe in themselves. ","A times when I had a big challenge in front of me and let in discourage me was when my football team played Stagg High School. The game was back and forth, and a lot of players on my team were getting injured. During the second quarter, I had hurt my ankle along with the other running back who had hurt his ankle as well. With us being short on player I went and changed my cleats and got back in the game. With us being down by two touchdowns many of my teammates felt discouraged and ready to go home, but it was my responsibility to encourage those on my team. I’ve always been the high spirited person who will never give up no matter the circumstances. After talking to different members of the team and getting them pumped up , when the fourth quarter came we went down and took the lead once again by a touchdown. When the game ended we walking out with the win that had carried with us for the rest of the season.","These are just two prime examples of when I faced difficult challenges and didn’t let them discourage me, but instead was able to fight through them despite my circumstances.

I was raised with not knowing my biological father, and never had a father for support while growing up. In the end of my sophomore year, they had a messy divorce and stopped communicating. I did not want my younger sister growing up without a father support as I did, so I took initiative in fixing their problems. I would communicate for both of them in order to schedule who takes care of Kasandra, and how bills are going to be paid. Soon after my mom lost her job. We had no money to pay for bills, rent, and food. I started working in order to help out with bills. I worked as many hours as possible in order to be able to help my mom pay the bills.On the days I did not work I would baby sit Kasandra, so my mom could take an extra shift at work since we could not afford a babysitter. We did not have family around either to help out with taking care of Kasandra, my little sister. Balancing work, school, and babysitting became challenging. I lost hope in believing I was going to be successful in school. I felt alone because no one in my family was there to support me with school. Only six people in my family had graduated from high school and none of them were able to help. I sought for help in my school. During lunch, I would stay in for tutoring with different teachers to be able to keep up with all my school work. I joined Trio for after school tutoring on the days I did not babysit or work. I excelled at school with the help of tutoring. I struggle with family and school as well and have difficulty focusing in school. I wanted to help others because without help I would not have been able to overcome my challenge, so I started tutoring others during lunch.","Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you.","My favorite academic subject is Spanish. The reason being Spanish was my first language. Spanish not only became a way to connect with family, but it also became part of my identity. I wanted to be able to help others who did not have the opportunity to learn English or Spanish. My junior year of high school, I joined Spanglish Club. I wanted to be able to help others in school, as I do at home by translating for family members. In Spanglish Club, I had the opportunity to teach English to students who did not have the opportunity to learn English in their family or school. Also, I taught Spanish to Latinx students who were English speakers only. I taught Spanish to break the barrier and distance of not being able to embrace and be part of their own culture. During the Summer, I took an Ethnic Studies at Evergreen Valley College. The course was to learn about Mexican/ American studies. This helped me to learn more about where I come from and to fully understand my identity. Spanish to me is more than just a subject, it's a way of life. Spanish is part of my culture and I learned to communicate and understand my culture through Spanish. I became part of an Aztec dancing group. I was able to connect with more bilingual speakers and learn more about where my ancestors come from and another side of history that is not taught in History Class. Spanish helped me embrace and find my identity. Spanish expanded my horizon and has allowed me to help others connect with their culture and embrace bilingualism.","Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.

I have always had an interest in technology and business, but I could not afford the cost of a program like this. Throughout the program, I got the opportunity to network with different companies such as Lyft, Twitter, and NetApp. This program taught me about different tech companies and helped me expand the different tech industries and learn new coding and computer skills through hands on experience. Through this program, I was able to network with many people in the tech industry in this program, I was able to learn how to take apart and put together a console. through this program, I found an interest in coding, was able to learn about HTML, and started designing my own business website. I learned everything this program had to offer and from this program, I was able to do a Latino Leadership Program by being invited by the Professor. This program gave me the opportunity to help small businesses by expanding their business profiles. One of the businesses I worked with was Little Angels Family Daycare. Coming from a low-income family, I never imagined I would be able to help others. I was extremely fortunate to be accepted into free programs that gave me the opportunity to explore business and technology.Learning from my own experience, I realized without help I would have never been able to participate in these programs so I decided to teach others about technology, such as coding."," What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?

The Spanglish club was a club at my school that taught English and Spanish to whoever wanted to learn more of that language. The meetings were every Wednesday during lunch in which I would teach English to Juan Mora. Juan understood some English, but was very shy to speak in English due to his accent. After, the first month of the Spanglish club, both Juan and I realized one hour a week was not enough time to learn English. We decided to meet after school as well, for twice a week from 4 pm-7:30pm. I was able to teach Juan English enough till he felt comfortable speaking to others in English. This was important for me to teach Juan because that was his last year of high school knowing little English is difficult finding a job in any industry. Teaching Juan and many other members of the Spanglish Club English and Spanish has helped them to be able to communicate, translate, and understand others better. I took joy in having the opportunity to give back to my community. Through the CDC program, I was able to help small local businesses with latino owners learn more about how put their business on the web. I enjoy helping my community which is why starting next week I am going to help small local business expand their business by creating a website, yelp account, g suite, domain, and google location consulting, and more. I am going to be able to help my community by being part of the Summer Youth Latino Leadership Program."],"tag":"new","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=715"},{"id":"1zKahdJ1DajhhjHJNdd697lTsCAXJ_CarKb_8SMGNTh8","featured":true,"prompt":"Common App","college":"","applicationStatus":"accepted","state":"","country":"United States of America","yearApplied":2018,"dateUploaded":"2018-11-11T06:12:04.346Z","image":"","paragraphs":["When I was 16, I lived with the Watkins family in Wichita, Kansas. Mrs. Watkins was the coordinator of the foreign exchange student program I was enrolled in. She had a nine year old son named Cody. I would babysit Cody every day after school for at least two to three hours. We would play Scrabble or he would read to me from Charlotte’s Web or The Ugly Duckling. He would talk a lot about his friends and school life, and I would listen to him and ask him the meanings of certain words. He was my first friend in the New World.","My second family was the Martinez family, who were friends of the Watkins’s. The host dad Michael was a high school English teacher and the host mom Jennifer (who had me call her “Jen”) taught elementary school. She had recently delivered a baby, so she was still in the hospital when I moved into their house. The Martinez family did almost everything together. We made pizza together, watched Shrek on their cozy couch together, and went fishing on Sunday together. On rainy days, Michael, Jen and I would sit on the porch and listen to the rain, talking about our dreams and thoughts. Within two months I was calling them mom and dad.","After I finished the exchange student program, I had the option of returning to Korea but I decided to stay in America. I wanted to see new places and meet different people. Since I wasn’t an exchange student anymore, I had the freedom--and burden--of finding a new school and host family on my own. After a few days of thorough investigation, I found the Struiksma family in California. They were a unique group.","The host mom Shellie was a single mom who had two of her own sons and two Russian daughters that she had adopted. The kids always had something warm to eat, and were always on their best behavior at home and in school. It would be fair to say that this was all due to Shellie’s upbringing. My room was on the first floor, right in front of Shellie’s hair salon, a small business that she ran out of her home. In the living room were six or seven huge amplifiers and a gigantic chandelier hung from the high ceiling. The kitchen had a bar. At first, the non-stop visits from strangers made me nervous, but soon I got used to them. I remember one night, a couple barged into my room while I was sleeping. It was awkward.","After a few months I realized we weren’t the best fit. In the nicest way possible, I told them I had to leave. They understood.","The Ortiz family was my fourth family. Kimberly, the host mom, treated me the same way she treated her own son. She made me do chores: I fixed dinner, fed their two dogs Sassy and Lady, and once a week I cleaned the bathroom. I also had to follow some rules: No food in my room, no using the family computer, no lights on after midnight, and no ride unless it was an emergency. The first couple of months were really hard to get used to, but eventually I adjusted.","I lived with the Ortiz family for seven months like a monk in the deep forest. However, the host dad Greg’s asthma got worse after winter, so he wanted to move to the countryside. It was unexpected and I only had a week to find a new host family. I asked my friend Danielle if I could live with her until I found a new home. That’s how I met the Dirksen family, my fifth family.","The Dirksen family had three kids. They were all different. Danielle liked bitter black coffee, Christian liked energy drinks, and Becca liked sweet lemon tea. Dawn, the host mom didn’t like winter, and Mark, the host dad, didn’t like summer. After dinner, we would all play Wii Sports together. I was the king of bowling, and Dawn was the queen of tennis. I don’t remember a single time that they argued about the games. Afterward, we would gather in the living room and Danielle would play the piano while the rest of us sang hymns.","Of course, those 28 months were too short to fully understand all five families, but I learned from and was shaped by each of them. By teaching me English, nine year-old Cody taught me the importance of being able to learn from anyone; the Martinez family showed me the value of spending time together as a family; the Struiksma family taught me to reserve judgment about divorced women and adopted children; Mrs. Ortiz taught me the value of discipline and the Dirksen family taught me the importance of appreciating one another’s different qualities.","Getting along with other people is necessary for anyone and living with five families has made me more sensitive to others’ needs: I have learned how to recognize when someone needs to talk, when I should give advice and when to simply listen, and when someone needs to be left alone; in the process, I have become much more adaptable. I’m ready to change, learn, and be shaped by my future families."],"tag":"featured","imageLink":"https://picsum.photos/1920/960?image=264"}]
